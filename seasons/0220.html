PHOEBE: What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> RACHEL: That's not the end.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.<br>
<br>
MONICA: What about the part where he has rabies?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.<br>
<br>
<a name="line04"></a> PHOEBE: What, what's about to happen? [starts watching] I've never
seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put

nothing but rubber gloves.<br>

[Chandler and Joey come sprinting in]<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come
over.<br>
<br>
<a name="line06"></a> MONICA: Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, how do you find clothes that fit?<br>
<br>
<a name="line07"></a> JOEY: Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and
no I don't look.<br>
<br>
JOEY: No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game
tonight, we have an extra ticket.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues
and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do
you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'<br>
<br>
<a name="line08"></a> MONICA: Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don't you ask Richard?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to
choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?<br>
<br>
<a name="line09"></a> RICHARD: Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you
should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ok, that's Eric.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Glad to be of help. Matches. [walks out to the balcony]<br>
<br>
MONICA: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?<br>
<br>
JOEY: I don't know.<br>
<br>
MONICA: C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.<br>
<br>
<a name="line10"></a> CHANDLER: I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh,
it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica
gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if
you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]<br>
<br>
<a name="line11"></a> JOEY: How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it
just to ride in the cool car?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ok, this could be tough.<br>
<br>
JOEY: [Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if
he takes the Jaguar.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ooh, you almost had it.<br>

ROSS: I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what,
the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he
spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?<br>
<br>
CAROL: Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet,
but once he said yumen.<br>

<a name="line14"></a> PHOEBE: Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the <i>Old Yeller</i>
incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield
us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.<br>

mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?<br>
<br>
<a name="line20"></a> JOEY: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than
me?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.<br>

[Chandler enters with his hair full of mousse and a cheesy moustache]<br>
<br>
<a name="line21"></a> ROSS: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.<br>
<br>
<a name="line22"></a> MONICA: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew
it, we'd look like dorks.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You're meeting Richard?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were
the guys.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: You hear that? We're the guys.<br>
<br>
JOEY: We're the guys.<br>

MONICA: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Thank you.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is working. Ross enters with Ben.]</b><br>
<br>
<a name="line23"></a> ROSS: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you
say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No luck huh?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into
sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I
gotta take this off.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]<br>
<br>
<a name="line24"></a> ROSS: What're you doing?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh, I'm holding Ben.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok.<br>
<br>
<a name="line25"></a> ROSS: Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: This is how I would hold a football.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ok, here, here. There we go.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around
them, I mean, you know, since I was one.<br>
<br>
ROSS: It's alright, it's no big deal.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Really?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
ROSS: What?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You think about stuff like that?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Two, two babies?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here
won't feel too competitive.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we
don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit
whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau
county but the school system's supposedly great.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Huh?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am
gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot.
I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a
door? [leaves]<br>

PHOEBE: Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So you watched the movies huh?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and
and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Charlotte who?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya

<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah.<br>

MONICA: So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, <i>Pride of the Yankees</i>, I thought I
was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.<br>

them for me, I mean, they have each other.<br>
<br>
<a name="line28"></a> RICHARD: Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with
those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start
sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'<br>
<br>
<a name="line29"></a> MONICA: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Uh, it's the college playoffs.<br>

who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.<br>

PHOEBE: Sure.<br>

<a name="line30"></a> MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know,
and I don't know, what do I do?<br>

your pets head off.<br>

MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.<br>
<br>
<a name="line31"></a> MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read
Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how
to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next
thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.<br>

<a name="line32"></a> ROSS: Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're
at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.<br>

RACHEL: Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for
six weeks.<br>
<br>
ROSS: C'mon, what, you never think about our future?<br>
<br>
<a name="line33"></a> RACHEL: Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep
at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not
think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are
gonna be.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I
thought, I thought that might be good.<br>

RACHEL: What was the book?<br>
<br>
ROSS: The big book of childrens' names.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like
that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not
knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are
gonna have to deal with that.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ok fine.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Thank you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: We're not done.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I didn't know that.<br>
<br>
<a name="line34"></a> ROSS: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a
guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna
end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.<br>

<br>
PHOEBE: Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed
the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear
bleed.<br>

MONICA: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty
wonderful?<br>
<br>

getting worse and worse, it should have been called, &quot;It's a sucky life and just when
you think it can't suck any more it does.&quot;<br>

<i>ERNIE: Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a
nice hole here. Hey.</i><br>
<br>
<a name="line45"></a> PHOEBE: [pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie
buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does
find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while
but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well
so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]<br>
<br>
<i>ERNIE: Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a
moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.</i><br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm so glad you're here.</font></p>
