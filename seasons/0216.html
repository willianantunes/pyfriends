at the bar, in their bathrobes, eating cereal]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his
hat?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a <b>cereal</b> for the
last 40 years.<br>
<br>
[Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Waaa-aaah.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, so.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my
toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the
first thing you wash.<br>
<br>

<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are sitting at the table, Joey
and Chandler enter.]</b><br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey.<br>
<br>
MONICA and PHOEBE: Hey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ahh.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Okey-doke.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?<br>
<br>
JOEY: So where you gettin' it?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]<br>
<br>
ROSS: What? What's on your shoulder?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.<br>
<br>
ROSS: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair
cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No, I think you should tell them.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them
anything.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and
Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: The Gellers' house. Monica, Ross, and Richard are arriving to Mr. Gellers
birthday party.]</b><br>
<br>
ROSS: Alright, shall we?<br>
<br>
MONICA: OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You
get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something
up.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
[opens door] We're here.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh hi kids. Hi darling.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Happy birthday dad.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Oh thank you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Hi ma.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Happy birthday.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: The Gellers' kitchen. Monica, Mrs. Geller and one of Mrs. Geller's friends are
preparing the cake.]</b><br>
<br>
FRIEND: Well, you kids take the train in?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.<br>
<br>
FRIEND: Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
[Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Are we still on that?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.<br>
<br>
FRIEND: She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still
pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Can you believe this place?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I know, this is a great apartment.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when
you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Huh?<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?<br>
<br>
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the
kitchen.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning -
on TV. Stop talking. OK.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross
observes.]</b><br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: C'mon, tell us.<br>
<br>
FRIEND: Yeah, is she really 20.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: I am not telling you guys anything.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Jack, would you let it go?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche.
You... you got your own little speedster.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Guys. Seriously, it is <b>not</b> like that.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. .
.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.]</b><br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well I. . .<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more
open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.<br>
<br>
TATTOO ARTIST: Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with
me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Here we go.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: [reluctantly] Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: You're not going?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No. Well, yeah, maybe.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals
boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What's 1922?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a
lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you
want to get this tattoo?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, who is the boss of you?!!<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart
tattooed on your hip. <b>GO</b>!!<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]</b><br>
<br>
RICHARD: How ya doin'?<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm a twinkie.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Really? I'm a hero.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: My parents are dead.<br>
<br>
MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the
bathroom] Judy, <b>going to the bathroom</b>, good for you.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.<br>
<br>
[Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks
his head in.]<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I
have one.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from <i>Cocoon</i>.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told
Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Really.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: C'mon, it's my birthday.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their
brunch.]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: What?<br>
<br>
JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place
where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here
by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live
together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well that's how I feel.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Well then maybe I will.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Fine with me.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the
spoons.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Mr. and Mrs. Geller enter looking particularly
refreshed. Monica follows looking rather pale.]</b><br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Who's drink can I freshen?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Almost time for cake.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Mon, Mon, are you OK?<br>
<br>
MONICA: You remember that video I found of mom and dad?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, I just caught the live show.<br>

ROSS: Eww.<br>

RICHARD: What?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Humm, really?<br>
<br>
[Mrs. Geller and Ross both enter]<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Uhh, not that I know of.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: That - that's an idea.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Ohh.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of
them aren't. Is that crystal?<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: A real doctor?<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's
sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Well that's wonderful. . . I<br>
<br>
MONICA: Mom, it's OK.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: It is Judy.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: [enters with his bat] Found it.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Dad, I'm the twinkie.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: You're the twinkie?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: She's not a twinkie.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh please, a relationship.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Really?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yes.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've
never seen Richard happier.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: When did I say that?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.<br>

the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.<br>

the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she

JOEY: Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah.<br>
<br>
