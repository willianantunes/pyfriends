about you? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Monica:</b> Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Phoebe:</b> My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Joey:</b> So? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? </font></p>

half empty.&quot; </font></p>

consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her

wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally&#151;(opens

Chandler, look at that. </font></p>

an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with
the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks
through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the
waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns,
and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-! </font></p>

for seven years after that. </font></p>

left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Ross:</b> My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles

and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. </font></p>

one? (To Phoebe) She was a <strong>big girl</strong>. </font></p>

in their pants in seventh grade! </font></p>
