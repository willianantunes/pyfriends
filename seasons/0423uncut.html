<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to
London and Monica comes running in.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get
a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there
could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>

<p>Joey</b>: What do you got there?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Condoms, dude!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey </b>(looks at the box): How come the writing is in Spanish?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Don't read my condoms!</p>
</font>

<p>[Cut to the girls' apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe and
Rachel watch.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
check! Traveller's cheques, check! </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Who are you saying &quot;check&quot; too?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing,
you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did
it the one time. But it was pretty weird.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: (entering) Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Hey! Are you ready yet?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Yep! You got the tickets?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Oh! Got 'em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!</p>

<p>[Cut to the guys' apartment.]</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: It's all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls' apartment.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: You got your passport?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.</p>

<p>(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesn't know why, it takes him a little bit to
figure it out.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: There it is.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Opening Credits</p>
</b>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where
everything is.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah,
the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this
stuff?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Yeah, okay, give that a try!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: (entering, with Joey) All right! Let's do it!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Woo-hoo!!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Yeah, cheerie-o! </p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: London baby!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: (louder) London baby!!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your
wedding, but I don't-can't get up.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, have a great wedding!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Thanks.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Hey! (Trots over)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in
your apartment.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's book as Rachel comes in from her room.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: (to Rachel) So, we're off.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Have fun!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh, I know.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: So-so come! Why don't you come?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: What?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: This is my wedding.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: (entering, with Phoebe's book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo!
Phewbedo! Phaybobo.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: (laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p>(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says &quot;bye.&quot; In the
hall, Joey says...)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!</p>

<p>(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show
moves it's entire production to an entirely different country to make a single episode. We
get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the London Marriott as Joey
and Chandler exit.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Street in front of the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is
carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Come on! Do something!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: I am, I'm ignoring you.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right,
first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his &quot;pop-up&quot; map of London. All
of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Oh, what the hell is that?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. (Points to the map.) Wait.
No, we wanna go... No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I'm gonna have to go into the map. (So
Joey literally steps into the map.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire
time are we?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Another street, somewhere along the River Thames, Ross, Emily, and Monica are
walking to where they're gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the
caterer.]</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was
going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say
there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna
be...</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: Well, up yours too!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: What?! </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>

<p>Emily</b>: Oh, that's not what it means?</p>
</font><b>

<p>Ross</b>: No! No! That's-that's time-out!</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: Sorry.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come
on.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Chicken Kiev?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant
than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.)
<font color="#0000ff">But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the
chickenella...</font> So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely
building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... (She stops suddenly, when she sees that
demolition has already started.) Oh my God!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: It's nice.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)</p>

<p>[Cut to inside.]</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are
we going to do?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: How's it gonna be all right?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Uh-huh, I see that.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what
happened. </p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: What? What?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: They tore it down a few days early.</p>
<font color="#0000ff">

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey are sitting on the top floor on one of the red coaches in
London that doesn't have a roof. Joey is very enthusiastic and is pointing at all the
different sights. Chandler is really embarrassed and tries to make him stop. Afterwards,
Joey tries to film Chandler with his video camera, and Chandler obviously hates this.
Then, Joey falls asleep, and Chandler tries to take the video camera away from him.
However, Joey is holding onto it (in his sleep) and won't let it go. Chandler pulls until
Joey lets it go, causing Chandler to fall out of his seat.]</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of
London and are approaching the Abbey.]</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey!
(Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the
name of this place.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Really? To what?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: To Put the Camera Away!!!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the
Abbey.)</p>
<font color="#0000ff">

<p>[Scene: A bridal shop somewhere in London. Monica is trying on her red bridesmaid
dress, and Emily is watching. A dressmaker is working on Monica's dress.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.</p>

<p>(The dressmaker puts a pin in the dress, but accidentally pricks Monica with it.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Oowww!!</p>
<b>

<p>Dressmaker</b>: Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered
chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life
is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you
postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all
the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have
salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's
gonna like you better than me.</p>

<p>(Emily smiles a bit and looks uncomfortable.)</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel
enters.]</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh. Oh.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay, I have a wedgie.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Okay, that is all you.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: So-so, what do you want for lunch?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, I do. What's the matter?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have
lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was
getting married...</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: (interrupting) Still in love with?! </p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah!</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: I'm not in love with Ross!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that
would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey,
y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but
feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I
have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in
love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God!
Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: We thought you knew!</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: We?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: You all know? Does Ross know?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be
like telling Monica, &quot;Hey, you like things clean.&quot; <font color="#0000ff">Or,
y'know, &quot;Hey, Joey, you're gay.&quot;</p>

<p>(Rachel stares at her.)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: What?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>The Vendor</b>: So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip
post cards...</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the
front of it.) Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Well, I don't have to buy that, &quot;I'm with stupid&quot; T-shirt
anymore.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you
think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Oh, I embarrass you? </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?</p>
<b>

<p>The Vendor</b>: He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?</p>
<b>

<p>The Vendor</b>: (looks around) They're all tourists.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're
gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you're gonna make me choose between you and
the hat? I choose the hat.</p>
<b>

<p>The Vendor</b>: Good choice.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Thanks.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going
to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away
trying to be cool.)</p>
<font color="#0000ff">

<p>(A man walks up to Joey and stares at Chandler and the flower stand. Joey turns around
to introduce himself.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.</p>

<p>(Joey shakes his hand. The man looks at him and his hat.)</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: The hotel, Ross's room, Emily is entering.]</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: Hello?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be
able to find a new place for the wedding.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: We don't have to.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: She said what?</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: She said, &quot;If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we
find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent
on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took
time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on
backwards.) This isn't right.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll
come back when we can do it right.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out
his pants)</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: Don't you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no
choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you
understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when
we're getting married.</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: So what are you saying? It's now or never?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: No. I'm saying it's now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: Or?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!</p>
<b>

<p>Emily</b>: It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't
understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at
all! (She storms out.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-(He catches something important in the zipper
and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the couch as Rachel returns carrying a bunch
of shopping bags.]</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: (depressed) Hi.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Manhattan does not have enough stores.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Well, I think I can help you get over him.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: You can?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Um-hmm.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: And a small piece of chocolate.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the
water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna
show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about
him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it
out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and
imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.
And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease,
it's-uck! Hah?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and
y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh,
aversion therapy.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: All right.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: So uh, now look at the picture...</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: All right, and umm... (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.) </p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Ow!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Okay, how do you feel now?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Well, I like you less!</p>

kick his shoe into a trash can that is standing on the TV. He can't do it.</font>]</p>

<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were
embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've
had a really lousy day.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Me too.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: Yeah?</p>

<b>

<p>Joey</b>: (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat. </p>
<b>

<p>Fergie</b>: (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: (on tape) Oh, Chandler.</p>
<b>

<p>Fergie</b>: Hi Chandler! (Waves) </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: That's... That's was...</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Oh my God!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: That's Fergie baby!!</p>
<b>

<p>Fergie</b>: Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>

<p>Joey</b>: (on tape) So, I hear you're single now...</p>
<b>

<p>Fergie</b>: Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much. (She smiles.)</p>
</font><b>

<p>Chandler</b>: How did you? How? How?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So,
I'm in my map and-and...(Ross enters) Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Hey!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Umm...</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when
the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: She said that?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Yeah.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Why?!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because
the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Excuse me?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: I don't know. A month?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did!
We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered
wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of
Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is
that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just
doing the flying nun.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Sometimes we were.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: That was pretty intense huh?</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there
because we were uncomfortable being out here!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler</b>: (glares at him) I hope he did!</p>

<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like
you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't
care if he looks like you.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the
chick and the duck are doing?</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't
been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?</p>

<p>Joey</b>: Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: So you're not homesick yet?</p>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Ooh, the pizza guy's here!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: What? You ordered pizza without me?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey
Special.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Two pizzas?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey</b>: Wait, well, where did you get it from?! </p>

<p>(Phoebe has already hung up, leaving Joey in the dark. So Joey decides to watch some TV
and turns on a rerun of Cheers, with the theme song playing. At first, he's happy, but as
the song progresses Joey gets depressed and homesick.)</p>

<p>Monica</b>: And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove),
okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and... (Points to Ross) You go.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross</b>: But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other
time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.</p>

<p>Emily</b>: It's perfect.</p>

<p>Rachel</b>: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you
don't have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) </p>

<p>Phoebe</b>: I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!</p>

deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.</p>

<p>Phoebe</b>: That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say,
&quot;Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel</b>: Ohh-Do you think he will?!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go,
you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You
missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.</p>

<p>Rachel</b>: Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, &quot;I do.&quot;

<b>

<p>Housekeeper</b>: This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is
not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then
asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.</p>

fun of people. Goodbye.</p>

where they are?</p>

<p>Housekeeper</b>: I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe</b>: Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn
somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there
and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.</p>

her.</p>

<p>Mr. Geller</b>: (Pointing items out on the bill.) Flowers, liquor, recarpet first
floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. (Angrily gets
up.) I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.</p>

time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks
embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over
inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear

<p>Rachel</b>: (They both just stare at her.)<font color="#0000ff">Y'know what? Fine, I
don't care. </font>Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs
and get a drink?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It's Phoebe!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh, yay...</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Great...</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Hi, so what happened?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Well, Ross said my name.</p>
<b>

<p>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth
grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in
a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler's room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after
seeing that he isn't, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Wow, you look...</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> No time for that!</p>

<p>(They both start to frantically rip each other's clothes off, but are interrupted when
Joey tries to open the door.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, I've got a girl in here.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie
in here?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's <i>My Giant</i>!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> <i>My Giant</i>? I <b>love</b> that movie!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Emily's room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place to do
the deed.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> You really think this is okay?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about
this.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The <b>room</b>
expects sex. The <b>room</b> would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other
honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p>(They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (entering) Emily?!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Nope, not under here!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> You didn't find her?</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No, I've looked everywhere!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think you should keep looking!</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah, for about 30 minutes.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Or 45.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept
moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right
here.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Well, it's getting late.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we're gonna go.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it's a very large plane.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> (disappointed) That's cool.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> But, we'll stay here with you.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate
this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.</p>

<p>(Chandler slowly takes his hand away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Emily's room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his head in
Monica's lap and his feet on Chandler's lap. Monica and Chandler are both still awake and
depressed.]</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> We have to leave for New York in an hour.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof,
don't you think?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B'
y'know, let's go for it.</p>

<p>(They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there's a knock on the
door that awakens him.)</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily!
(He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> No.</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham:</b> You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> We've come for her things.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you
ever again.</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham:</b> We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.
But, I think you're absolutely delicious.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> Excuse me, I'm standing right here!</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Oh yes, there you are.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh
hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside... (Sees the Walthams and stops.)</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> Goodbye Geller.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are
supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at
that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it
didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! (Rachel sits down,
depressed.) That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine
spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> All right, I'll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!</p>
<b>

<p>Mrs. Waltham:</b> (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.</p>
<b>

<p>Mr. Waltham:</b> You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out
the bloody window!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[Scene: A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in
first class, depressed.]</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realises something)
Y'know, technically we still <b>are</b> over international waters.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> 'Kay!</p>

<p>(Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is
startled to see Joey sitting in Monica's seat.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Can I ask you something?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Uhh, no.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Felicity and I, we're watching <i>My Giant</i>, and I was thinking, &quot;I'm
never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.&quot; Do you think I'm just wasting my life
with this acting thing?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> No.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll
ever get there?</p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Thanks man. </p>
<b>

<p>Chandler:</b> Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> But what about how much taller he is than me?</p>

<p>(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows
what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful,
regular sized man?</p>

<p>(Monica returns.)</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.</p>
<b>

<p>Monica:</b> I know!</p>
<b>

<p>Joey:</b> Had the beef-tips, huh?</p>

<p>Rachel:</b> So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?</p>
<strong>

<p>Gate Agent:</strong> (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The
last call.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Pretty soon I guess.</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeah. I'm sorry.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am
I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Same difference.</p>
<strong>

<p>Gate Agent:</strong> (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens
should now be on board.</p>

<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> No, you know what, I think you should go.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear
your head, I think it'd be really good.</p>
<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...</p>
<b>

<p>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be <b>really</b> good for you!</p>

<b>

<p>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry
over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?</p>
