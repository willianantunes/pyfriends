[Rachel brings a muffin to Chandler and Monica who are sitting on the couch.]<br>
<br>
<a name="line01"></a> RACHEL: Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.<br>
<br>
[Rachel holds the tray between them. Chandler grabs the muffin before Monica can.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, I ordered mine first.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...<br>
<br>
MONICA: Give it to me.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: No.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Give it to me.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]<br>
<br>
<a name="line02"></a> MONICA: [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.]
There you go, enjoy your coffee.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.<br>
<br>
MONICA: [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the
muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.<br>
<br>
[Chandler is visibly upset]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You went out with a guy in the Navy?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in
salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have
the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole
weeks, which means yay.<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> RACHEL: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?<br>
<br>
[Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.]<br>
<br>
MONICA: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [enters] Hiii.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh no, what happened?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.<br>
<br>
ALL: Oh no.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well I've had it.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah, I've had it.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Had it.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Had it.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh
look!<br>

<br>
<a name="line04"></a> MONICA: Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to
do that. This isn't camp.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am
going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.<br>
<br>
[He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover
it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the
fattest man in the whole damn town?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: What're you doing?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Just waiting for you sweetie.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Are you remaking the bed?<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Then, you're redoing it because...<br>
<br>
<a name="line05"></a> MONICA: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: You're pretty much running that risk either way.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the
bottom right corner.<br>
<br>
<a name="line06"></a> RICHARD: Oh, well that's not so crazy.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm just easing you in.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh, alright.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down,
because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more
do you.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.<br>
<br>
<a name="line07"></a> MONICA: Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.<br>

<b>[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey is there.]</b><br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can
get you a job right here as an entry level processor.<br>
<br>
JOEY: But don't you need experience for a job like that?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what
you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a
processor.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: [enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: No kidding.<br>
<br>
<a name="line08"></a> JOEY: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the
one they call.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: Where do you work?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're
processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.<br>
<br>
SCOTT: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?<br>

RACHEL: Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You look fabulous honey, you really do.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches
all over her face.]<br>
<br>
<a name="line09"></a> RACHEL: You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I, I, I'm hideous.<br>
<br>
<a name="line10"></a> MONICA: It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna
be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ryan is walks up to the door and knocks.]</b><br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Come in.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Hey baby, I'm back... [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hey Ryan, what's up?<br>
<br>
RYAN: What's goin' on?<br>
<br>
<a name="line11"></a> PHOEBE: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Chicken or small?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Why aren't you at home in bed?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you
have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.<br>
<br>
RYAN: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ohh, ohh.<br>
<br>
<a name="line12"></a> RYAN: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go
back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub
him all over my face.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Can I please see your face?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is
me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in
terror.] Oh, I am scary.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely,
lovely.<br>
<br>
<a name="line13"></a> PHOEBE: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two
weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than
this.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about
this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her
and kisses her.]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey enters.]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Hey, how's the first day goin'?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column
into another column.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well there you go.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red
hair, Jeannie.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?<br>
<br>
<a name="line14"></a> JOEY: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world
huh?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Weird world. Your kids?<br>
<br>
<a name="line15"></a> JOEY: I figure my character has kids.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.<br>
<br>
<a name="line16"></a> JOEY: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff
like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and
Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.<br>
<br>
<a name="line17"></a> JOEY: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a
third kid... Ya know what? Just did.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Ryan are playing Monopoly.]</b><br>
<br>
RYAN: You know what makes the itching even worse?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: That you don't stop talking about it.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Fine.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes,
here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama,
just getting ready to roll the dice...<br>
<br>
RYAN: What're you doing? Are you scratching?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. This is what I do for luck, ok.<br>
<br>
RYAN: You're scratching. Give me the dice.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No.<br>
<br>
RYAN: Give me the dice.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.<br>
<br>
RYAN: We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all
these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]<br>
<br>
RYAN: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Give it.<br>
<br>
RYAN: No.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just
be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]<br>
<br>
RYAN: Oh God help me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.<br>
<br>
[They get back to back and start rubbing against each other. Ross and Rachel enter.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, stop that, stop that right now.<br>
<br>
ROSS: You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler's office building. Joey and Jeannie are talking.]</b><br>

JOEY: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the
kids, we'll make a day of it.<br>
<br>
JEANNIE: Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.<br>
<br>
<a name="line18"></a> JEANNIE: Bye bye Joey.<br>
<br>
JOEY: What a phony.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto
nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Sir.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the
systems report until next Friday?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: I have a family, I'm gonna be here.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Yeah Bing, what's that about?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you
wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: Rough numbers?<br>
<br>
JOEY: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.<br>
<br>
MR. DOUGLAS: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Uh, if you say so sir.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Joseph's good, isn't he?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm going to kill you.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get
in there, ruffle some feathers.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Why?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll
call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.<br>

tape. Richard is sitting on the bed.]</b><br>

MONICA: This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.<br>

RICHARD: You're strict.<br>
<br>
MONICA: It's for their own good.<br>

tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.<br>

you now. <a name="line21"></a>Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that
everything on your desk is perpendicular?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.<br>

MONICA: Very good.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Thank you.<br>

MONICA: You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: You're gonna do what to my clocks.<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm gonna set them to my time.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.<br>
<br>
<a name="line22"></a> MONICA: No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
You wanna know why?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: No come on. Come on tell me.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No. See you don't understand.<br>

RICHARD: Yeah.<br>

RICHARD: Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress
socks.<br>

MONICA: What if they get mixed up?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.<br>
<br>
<a name="line23"></a> MONICA: You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too
normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a

<br>
CHANDLER: Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?<br>

JOEY: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns
out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a
lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not
possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.<br>

JOEY: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.<br>

Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. [He
carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.] Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off
