PHOEBE: I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV
with your feet up.<br>
<br>
<a>CHANDLER</a>: Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the
wild.<br>
<br>
ROSS: This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.<br>

MONICA: I've been great, just great. How have you been? [tilting her head]<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have
done the head tilt.<br>
<br>
MONICA: The head tilt?<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a
sympathetic head tilt. [demonstrating] 'How ya doin'? You OK?'<br>
<br>
MONICA: I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm
OK' head bob. [demonstrates] 'I'm OK.' [tilts head] 'You sure?' [bobs head] 'Yeah, I'm
fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the
divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.<br>
<br>
MONICA: [her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: [bobbing his head] I'll survive.<br>

DR. BURKE: But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You're an opthamologist.<br>
<br>
DR. BURKE: Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: [entering the kitchen from the party] That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get

MONICA: Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.<br>

PHOEBE: Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.<br>
<br>
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Rachel are returning from a movie.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a
little. . . hard to follow.<br>
<br>
ROSS: I told you there was going to be sub-titles.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.<br>
<br>
[They start kissing.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Monica.<br>
<br>

on Rachel's butt. Rachel starts laughing.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: What, what.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my
butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.<br>
<br>
ROSS: And that's, that's funny why?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya

<br>
ROSS: I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: OK. [start kissing again and Rachel starts lauging again]<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK, my hands were no where near your butt.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the
last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm
not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.<br>

<p>RACHEL: Just one cheek.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.<br>

<br>
[Scene: Museum of Natural History. Ross is fixing a display, Rachel is waiting patiently.]<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use

ROSS: You're not laughing.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: This time it's not so funny.<br>
<br>
[They kiss and start undressing. As Rachel tries to pull off Ross's tie she catches it in
his mouth. Then they roll across the fur rug.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.<br>
