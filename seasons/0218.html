<br>
ROSS: I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?<br>
<br>
MONICA: We, we just wanna see the end.<br>
<br>
<i>AMBER: I want you Drake.<br>

DR. REMORE: I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.<br>

DR. REMORE: There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.</i><br>
<br>
[Everyone gasps. The show ends.]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: So what happens next?<br>
<br>
<a name="line01"></a> JOEY: Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese
twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's
where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.<br>

Phoebe to play a game with him.]</b><br>
<br>
<a name="line02"></a> CHANDLER: Phoebs, play with meeee.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel
bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> CHANDLER: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're
done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Why don't you play with your roommate?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy
that, shall we?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: We don't need to remedy that.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]<br>
<br>
EDDIE: What was that?<br>
<br>
<a name="line04"></a> PHOEBE: Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of
us had some beers and got to know each other.<br>
<br>
EDDIE: Yeah alright, that sounds alright.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That was so lame.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment. Chandler and Eddie are talking.]</b><br>
<br>
EDDIE: That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?<br>
<br>
<a name="line05"></a> CHANDLER: What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually
thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.<br>
<br>
EDDIE: That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well it's not Sean Penn.<br>
<br>
<a name="line06"></a> EDDIE: Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My
last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes,
there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she
says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it
was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all
over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm
falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. [finishes laughing] That
uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?<br>

<b>[Scene: Central Perk. Joey enters with several magazines and runs up to Phoebe.]</b><br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Page 42, page 42, page 42.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.'
Ooh, cool picture.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Ooh, I look good.<br>
<br>
<a name="line14"></a> PHOEBE: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well
the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to
die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are
gonna be kinda mad when they read this?<br>
<br>
JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my
house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which
makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: At a writer's desk. The writer is working on a script for Days of Our Lives.]</b><br>
<br>
WRITER: Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Joey's apartment. The next script is being delivered.]</b><br>

JOEY: I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator
shaft?<br>
<br>
DELIVERY GUY: Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.<br>
<br>
JOEY: They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.<br>
<br>
<a name="line15"></a> DELIVERY GUY: Right. Could you sign this?<br>
<br>
JOEY: No. No way, I'm not signing that.<br>
<br>
DELIVERY GUY: I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.<br>
<br>
JOEY: How can they do this to me?<br>
<br>
DELIVERY GUY: Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Richard, Ross, and Rachel are
returning.]</b><br>
<br>
<a name="line16"></a> MONICA: Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how
many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.<br>
<br>
ROSS: G'night.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Night Richard. Good luck Mon.<br>
<br>
<a name="line17"></a> MONICA: Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how
many women you've been with.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Two.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my
high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]<br>
<br>
<a name="line18"></a> RICHARD: Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh
c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.<br>
<br>
[Rachel's bedroom]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Uhhhooo.<br>
<br>
<a name="line19"></a> ROSS: C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.<br>
<br>
<a name="line20"></a> RACHEL: Well, there's you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Better not be doin' these in order.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I
ever was with him.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Really?<br>
<br>
<a name="line21"></a> RACHEL: Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All
it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo
much better in my head.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]</b><br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.<br>
<br>
EDDIE: That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with
her would say.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a
fish tank, and left, end of story.<br>
<br>
EDDIE: Where's Buddy?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Buddy?<br>
<br>
EDDIE: My fish, Buddy.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: There was no fish when she dropped it off.<br>
<br>
EDDIE: Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend
then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?<br>
<br>
<a name="line22"></a> CHANDLER: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand
on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're
just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up
the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are in Monica's bedroom.]</b><br>
<br>
RICHARD: That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well yeah.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.<br>
<br>
MONICA: You really ok with it?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Oh honey, I'm fine.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, yay. Ok about that two.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: What? Alright, what about my two?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Well, it just seems like a really small number.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Right, and...<br>
<br>
MONICA: And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing
with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat
guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.<br>
<br>
MONICA: But you've only slept with two people.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Right.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.<br>
<br>
RICHARD: Now I do. [they kiss and fall to the bed]<br>
<br>
[Ross and Rachel are in Rachel's bedroom]<br>
<br>
<a name="line23"></a> RACHEL: Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much
better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me
laugh.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and
have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock
jokes.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...<br>
<br>
<a name="line24"></a> ROSS: Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're
saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like,
uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good
with Paolo.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Knock-knock.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have
intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed]<br>

Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.<br>

CHANDLER: So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Why?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.<br>
<br>
<a name="line27"></a> PHOEBE: Why would you kill his fish?<br>

smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind
of irony or somethin.<br>
<br>
<a name="line30"></a> PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it
was just a dumb soap opera.<br>
<br>
JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have
something nice to say.<br>

that's nice.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?<br>
<br>
JOEY: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you
think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But
this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card
application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my
life.<br>
