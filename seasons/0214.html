<a name="line11"></a> JOEY: You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?<br>

<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting at the couch.
Ross is sitting at the table and answers the phone.]</b><br>
<br>
<a name="line25"></a> ROSS: Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message?
Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK,
bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Oh, some guy she met at the movies.<br>
<br>
<a name="line12"></a> ROSS: Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little
love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [puts the message in the cupboard] I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I
mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm
takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be
takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we
should get some kind of me, message service.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Hang in there, it's gonna happen.<br>
<br>
<a name="line13"></a> ROSS: Wha, OK, now how do you know that?<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Because she's your lobster.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, she's goin' somewhere.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.
You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya
know, holding claws like. . .<br>
<br>
[Monica enters from bathroom after taking a shower]<br>
<br>
<a name="line02"></a> CHANDLER: Hey, you feelin' better?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.<br>
<br>
<a name="line03"></a> PHOEBE: So, do you have any other possibilities?<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.<br>
<br>
MONICA: No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You
feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls
off]<br>
<br>
<a name="line04"></a> PHOEBE: What is that sparkly thing?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica answers the door and lets her parents in.
They are carrying boxes.]</b><br>
<br>
MONICA: Hi.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Hi.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Hi darling.<br>
<br>
MONICA: So, what's this.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Some of your old stuff.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and
plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.<br>
<br>
MONICA: Oh, God forbid.<br>
<br>
[Rachel enters with a laundry basket]<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh, hi Rachel.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Hi.<br>
<br>
MRS. GELLER: Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What, what incident?<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't
you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. [shuffles her into her room]<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting on couches. A beautiful woman is

CHANDLER: No, I'm alright, thanks.<br>
<br>
<a name="line06"></a> PHOEBE: OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this
just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her
best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really
good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: [walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of
Wendy's.<br>
<br>
GAIL: I'm Gail.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]<br>
<br>
GAIL: I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.<br>
<br>
<a name="line14"></a> CHANDLER: What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent.
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he
has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: It's not that bad.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some
reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: Chandler, Chandler.<br>
<br>
<a name="line15"></a> CHANDLER: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity
the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh,
impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without
saying anything] That's actually good.<br>
<br>
<b>[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is talking to a man at the counter. Ross and Phoebe are

<br>
ROSS: Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like,
back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.<br>
<br>
PHOEBE: I think she's OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: [Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy's shoulder] Look at that, look at that,
see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. [walks
up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What?<br>
<br>
ROSS: I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: What are you, what are you doin'?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if
it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.<br>
<br>
MAN: Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.<br>
<br>
ROSS: OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. [man leaves] You're welcome.<br>

RACHEL: OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.<br>

<br>
RACHEL: Ross, there is no us, OK.<br>
<br>
ROSS: No, but. . .<br>
<br>
RACHEL: No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I
again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not
worth it.<br>
<br>
ROSS: Well, but, but. . .<br>

RACHEL: NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.<br>

doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.<br>
<br>
JOEY: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say
something about our friendship and how much it means to me?<br>
<br>
<a name="line17"></a> JOEY: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and
you made fun of me?<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on
that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a
hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing
from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just
uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]<br>
<br>
JOEY: You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]<br>
<br>
<a name="line18"></a> CHANDLER: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as
a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may
haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]<br>

<a name="line26"></a> MONICA: Where have you been?<br>
<br>
ROSS: Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?<br>
<br>
MONICA: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.<br>
<br>
ROSS: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.<br>
<br>
<a name="line05"></a> MONICA: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you

MR. GELLER: Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught
her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?<br>
<br>
MONICA and ROSS: In the bank.<br>
<br>
MR. GELLER: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's
gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. [pulls a quarter
from behind her ear]<br>

<a name="line27"></a> PHOEBE: Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play
in the hay.<br>
<br>
CHANDLER: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just
dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.

<br>
RACHEL: [comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I've got something

CHANDLER: No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know
that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me
and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.<br>
