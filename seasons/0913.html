<P>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's]</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Hey!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what 
happened here last night?</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like 
you! Do you believe that who ever<BR>did something over here last night did what 
they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: No!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from 
her office out on your balcony.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica 
we should put lights on our balcony. And she said<BR>"No, no. It's too cold, 
nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they 
will"</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel 
kissing some guy on your balcony,<BR>even though there were NO LIGHTS !</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: So are you gonna...talk to her?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's 
fine!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it 
and spits!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care 
but...at least she could have told me. You know<BR>I...I've been putting my life 
on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing 
guys she<BR>barely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! 
Ah!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where 
you're moving?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now 
there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.<BR>And then the other 
day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who 
totally came on to me during the inter-departmental<BR>Potluck dinner.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Why did I get married?!</P>

<P>[Scene: Central Perk]</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken 
tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I<BR>should have my eyebrows 
waxed. Is that weird for a guy?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Well it depends.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: On...?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: On how far along he's in the sex change process!</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do 
something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,<BR>your eyebrows 
are...</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Wow! Talking about high maintenance</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Hey hey! You dye your hair!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: I'm a woman!</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Arghhh! Double standards!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar 
tonight?</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable 
old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out<BR>and everyone 
booed him off the stage. So funny.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: It's just, I'm not good at singing.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better 
singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to 
sing.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass 
judgments on others?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: While drinking...</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: I'm there!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something 
really stupid.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out 
there</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Oh my god.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: You kissed him?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony 
and...</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed 
that?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping 
paper.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me 
and, oh and he gave me this scarf...</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: I thought you hated him?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and 
it turns out that line...is a scarf!</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: So are you thinking of starting up something with this 
guy?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you 
know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't<BR>know what to do 
and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, 
and you definitely should talk to Ross</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss 
a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Beauty salon]</P><B>
<P>Salon girl</B>: Hi</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.</P><B>
<P>Salon girl:</B> Name?</P><B>
<P>Joey:</B> Chandler Bing.</P><B>
<P>Salon girl:</B> Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia 
will be right with you.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: OK Thanks.<BR>(Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the 
stuff</P><B>
<P>Sonia</B>: I'll take care of it</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?</P><B>
<P>Sonia</B>: Oh absolutely.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Oh good...</P><B>
<P>Sonia</B>: Are you looking to meet somebody?</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: All right let's just do this.</P><B>
<P>Sonia</B>: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of 
the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My 
face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!<BR>Just a little bit of shock 
that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK<BR>(He tries to avoid the 
tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!</P>
<P>[Scene: Central Perk]</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on 
going?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand 
but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I 
mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,<BR>two 
illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to 
me</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just 
an impulsive one-time birthday thing</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a 
bar.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Did she go out with him?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Ah! The high road...</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey 
check out those two blondes over there!<BR>Hey come with me!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?</P><B>
<P>Ross</B>: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the 
two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the<BR>ice with some kind of 
jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some 
interesting conversation, so<BR>they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, 
sexy one...</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: I thought I had to make the jokes!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Don't you have to be at work?</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend 
Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. <BR>We only 
need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the 
paper...another flood in Europe? Here’s a question: "Would you...<BR>would you 
rather drown or be burnt alive?"</P><B>
<P>Blonde girl</B>: Sorry...we were just leaving</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: We still got it!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross']</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Who is it?</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Gavin! I brought you some soup.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Why?</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: I heard you were sick...</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little 
bit! Hello Gavin</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I 
thought you called in sick to avoid me.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh no no no</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: So I had fun last night</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: So did I</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold 
for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: It's just a cold</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: What? What's the matter?</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be 
funny.</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want 
to get in the middle of anything</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, 
don't worry about Ross really, really.<BR>(She hears the noise of the key in the 
lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!</P><B>
<P>Molly</B>: Hi!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.</P><B>
<P>Molly</B>: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Right, right, yes!</P><B>
<P>Molly</B>: Don't panic!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: What?</P><B>
<P>Molly</B>: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my 
purse.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my 
business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.<BR>Gavin come out from behind 
that curtain!</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand 
there.</P><B>
<P>Molly</B>: Hello! I just go and get Emma.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: OK.</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: So hum...Why did I have to hide?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: I thought it was Ross.</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between 
you two...</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: There isn't. There is totally isn't.</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming 
out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a<BR>rodeo clown.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were 
here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in<BR>any relationship 
but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus 
there is just so much<BR>history...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, 
I'm just all over the place.</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a 
piece of advice?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Yes</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: Don't be. It's just bad timing.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: So seriously...rodeo clown?</P><B>
<P>Gavin</B>: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Mike's piano bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the 
world...!" Thank you!</P>
<P>(Mike kisses Phoebe)</P><B>
<P>Mike</B>: Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to 
get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth<BR>singing "I touch 
myself"...I'm not here to judge!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: No I told you I can't.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice 
voice.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: What have you heard me sing?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: All the time when you're cooking.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: What?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in 
my tummy"</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Yeah I do rock that one.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up 
there?</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I 
would sing...</P><B>
<P>Mike</B>: Well I've got a book around...</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: "Delta Dawn"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Central Perk]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace</P><B>
<P>Woman</B>: You already hit on me an hour ago</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep 
striking out.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, 
you're asking women how they want to be killed</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the 
one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: By drowning or...?!</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Why would he break up with me?</P><B>
<P>Her friend</B>: I don't know sweetie.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. 
I mean, am I so unlovable?</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Well...</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I know! (he stands)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Piano bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Mike</B>: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of 
"I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica<BR>singing "Delta 
Dawn".</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that 
spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone<BR>anyway.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn"<BR>"Delta 
Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone 
by? ..."</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Can you totally see through her shirt ?</P><B>
<P>Mike</B>: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Hey, I need your help.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley 
Judd?</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my 
eyebrows shaped</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All 
right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one<BR>eyebrow and now... they 
don’t match!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic 
marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so<BR>I don’t look stupid for my 
pictures.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Ok. First of all, this is green!</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: What the hell am I supposed to do!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you 
will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: What, what.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the 
lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine<BR>by plucking the eyebrows 
of my father and his “business” partners.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Oh my God!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor 
Victoria!</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, 
but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore<BR>plucking. It hurts so 
bad!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my 
gentle self-loathing touch.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Piano Bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is 
over. Did you see me out there?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Every little bit of you!</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the 
people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that<BR>one shouting “look at those 
tips”! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?</P><B>
<P>Mike</B>: Sure.</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but...</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for 
making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.</P><B>
<P>Mike</B>: Also a good gift? Underwear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross']</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms 
freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do<BR>anything else.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: It’s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with 
me, because it’s like you lose a boyfriend,<BR>you get a boyfriend.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Uh-ah!</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: No don’t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally 
over Eric.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> (pfew). Good choice Ross.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you 
everywhere!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. 
So I was hoping you and I could have a<BR>chance to kind of talk… somebody 
here?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Who?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: You’ve being seeing someone?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going 
out for too long, but rather there is this<BR>amazing connection between us. I-I 
mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it 
was<BR>a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: What are you taking amoxicillin for?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look 
through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that’s<BR>my roommate, Rachel.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Ah, who is Emma?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I told you about my daughter.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: And done!</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a 
job because you can tweeze circles around<BR>that sadistic bitch at the 
saloon</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look 
great! How you doing!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little 
worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about<BR>there, but it turned out to 
be a little piece of chocolate.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Thank you so much.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: No problem.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some 
manly make up for it.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Yeah.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Comb my eyelashes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Piano Bar]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more 
upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer<BR>Sisters “I am so excited”. And 
make it bouncy!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see 
Joey.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another 
song!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Really? In front of all this people?</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: And they love me!</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Oh my God!</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Yes, she gives the people what they want.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: All right, watch!</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll 
put all other things aside. Give in this<BR>time and show me some 
affection..."</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: Are those my wife’s nipples?</P><B>
<P>Phoebe</B>: Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have 
let her go up again.</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: I gotta stop this.</P><B>
<P>Monica</B>: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."</P><B>
<P>Chandler</B>: You, touching yourself, out!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross’]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Wow. She does that a lot!</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Ross, you didn’t tell me you were a doctor!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a 
doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like<BR>an hour?</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Actually about an hour and a half.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection 
between us.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Are you kidding?</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> We’ll see.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange 
women back to the apartment now?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: How do you know about that?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to 
sleep...</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Emma.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a 
guy you know, for what? A week?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to 
get back at me?</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: No, actually, see I had to pee, ‘cause I can’t use public 
bathrooms because the doodie parasites.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: Well, call me!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Ok.</P><B>
<P>Michelle</B>: No, wait, you don’t have my phone number!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it. Bye, bye.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Score.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we 
could come to one of your kissing parties on<BR>the balcony.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. 
It was one kiss, one guy, one time!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Oh, really!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Yeah.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Oh, really!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh yeah.</P><B>
<P>Ross</B>: What about the guy from the bar?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: What? Who?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> The guy you gave your number to.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Whoa, how do you know about that?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Because he called here looking for you. So don’t tell me 
this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,<BR>ok? You’ve been 
out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn’t even 
have the courtesy to tell me.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Why didn’t I get that message?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> What?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you 
not look there?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Ross?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I never gave it to you.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Why?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I don’t know.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to 
decide what messages I should or should not get?</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Who am I?</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Yes.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars 
meeting guys!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in 
here hoping to have a mature conversation with you<BR>About us! But I can’t do 
that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my 
apartment!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the 
point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one<BR>Who moved on and didn’t tell 
anyone!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You 
know when people hear about our situation they<BR>Always ask, “what, you live 
together but you’re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn’t that weird?» And I 
say “No.<BR>You know what, it’s not, because it works for us!» But you know this 
doesn’t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Uh, clearly.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as 
long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,<BR>Just doesn’t make sense 
anymore.</P><B>
<P>Ross:</B> Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Hey!</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Ha, oh, of course.</P><B>
<P>Rachel</B>: Thank you.</P><B>
<P>Joey</B>: Your eyebrows look weird.</P>

<P>Chandler</B>: “Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never 
understood a single word he said, but I helped him<BR>drink his wine.” So you 
just touch yourself for anything?</P>
