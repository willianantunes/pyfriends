<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&#146;know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has
happened.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know. <b>Ross</b> is getting married.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe is, making people.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Everybody&#146;s doing stuff!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, not something stupid, something huge.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why not?! I mean it&#146;s just, it&#146;s just climbing! It&#146;s
just, it&#146;s just steep!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> We&#146;re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass
print on Everest!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What-what&#146;s up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We&#146;re gonna climb Mt. Everest!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah baby!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and
y&#146;know you can die. And, you would die!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (dejected) Yeah, well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> We could get that Everest video though.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we could do that without y&#146;know risking our lives at all!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And while we&#146;re down at the video store, you know what else we could
rent? <i>Die Hard</i>! (Chandler&#146;s excited.) Oh, y&#146;know what? I just remembered,
that Everest thing is only available through mail order.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (dejected) Oh, well&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you guys&#146;ll stay here and hang out with me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeeeeahhhh.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But I&#146;ll tell you something. One of these days we&#146;re get off
of our buts and rent <i>Die Hard</i> again!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah we are!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he&#146;s so cheap, he&#146;d never fly to
London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her
some envelopes.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Yeah, they&#146;re fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> If anyone asks, we&#146;ll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through
the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure. Why not?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I don&#146;t think I&#146;d be comfortable with any of my old lovers
there.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn&#146;t invite her?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, no-no, y&#146;know I absolutely adore Rachel it&#146;s just that,
well it might be a awkward for you. But it&#146;s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)
More tea?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah sure.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Earl Grey?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and
then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To

um, major crush on you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I knew.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here&#151;but do you think it would be okay if I asked you
out? Sometime? Maybe?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, maybe...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay... okay, maybe I will...</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's balcony, Ross is about to be attacked by Paulo's cat.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]</p>

<p>(She thinks it over, and then walks away.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I could not have done this without you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy
for me to see you with Julie?</p>

you&#146;ve grown. Y'know?&nbsp; I mean my Mom <b>never</b> thought this would work out.
It was all, &#147;Once a cheater, always a cheater.&#148;&nbsp; Ooh, I just wish we

asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica&#146;s photo albums, I mean you

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn&#146;t know that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I never knew that either.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn&#146;t know that, but you

with Phoebe! Y&#146;know she&#146;s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to
help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You don&#146;t have a car. And your license expired. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there&#146;s so much to do and I have
so little time to do it in.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do
whilst in London.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
there&#146;s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) &quot;It&#146;s almost as good as being there.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s better! You can&#146;t go to a museum in your underwear!</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Chandler: </strong>Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time.</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!</p>
