What’s wrong?</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt    didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t    compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>What?</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.    (Pause) It’s interesting.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Okay, let’s talk about something else.</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.

What was he talking about?</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>I don’t know!

What exactly did he say to you?</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Okay, he was talking about rules.</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-huh.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, and looking at people differently.</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>He didn’t say anything about that to me.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>What did he tell you?</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of    course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants    to do what you and I did in London with someone.</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>But what did he mean by rules?</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>Because he was looking at her differently.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!</p><b></b><p><b>Phoebe: </b>(from outside the bathroom) You guys?</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>You don’t say anything.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the    greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all    start having babies?</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>I’m not going to let you say anything.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)</p><b></b><p><b>Chandler: </b>Oh, God!</p><p>(Monica runs out to Phoebe, who is in the kitchen)</p><b></b><p><b>Phoebe: </b>Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Oh, you had that? </p><b></b><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica:</b> I thought I lost it.

Joey?! You don’t say.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>Is it something you’d be interested in?</p><b></b><p><b>Phoebe: </b>I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean,    on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I    can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.</p><b></b><p><b>Monica: </b>I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?</p><b></b><p><b>Phoebe: </b>Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt.    Well, I must say, I am on fire!
