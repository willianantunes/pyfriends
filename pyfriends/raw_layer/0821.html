<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there except Monica as Ross enters carrying a huge
stack of newspapers.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the
table.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well that&#146;s no way to sell newspapers. Why don&#146;t you try,
&quot;Extra! Extra! Read all about it!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, Monica&#146;s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all
gasp.) I didn&#146;t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all
the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, this is bad! And I&#146;ve had my share of bad reviews. I still
remember my first good one though. (Quoting) &quot;Everything else in this production of <i>Our
Town</i> was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!
It must be a good review! Is it great?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (reading) Oh dear God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What about the rest of Manhattan?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, they all know.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, this is horrible!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m so humiliated!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah but y&#146;know what they say Mon, &quot;There&#146;s no such thing
as bad press.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You don&#146;t think that umm, (reading) &quot;The chef&#146;s Mahi Mahi
was awful awful,&quot; is bad press?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I didn&#146;t write it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is he right? Am I really&#151;Am I awful?</p>

<p><b>All:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I&#146;m not just saying
this because I&#146;m your friend, I&#146;m sayin&#146; it &#145;cause it&#146;s the
truth. You&#146;re food is abysmal!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, it&#146;s late at night, Rachel is sitting on the couch in
the dark wide-awake as Ross walks to the bathroom.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (startling him) What?! What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am freaking out!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Are ya?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> My due date is in one week! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing up?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is seven days!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this
after&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have
any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not
have a diaper service!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s funny you should mention diapers.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m serious.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay look, there&#146;s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.
There&#146;s a great baby furniture store on west 10<sup>th</sup>. Tomorrow, we will go
there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Thank you. That&#146;s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west
10<sup>th</sup>? Because there&#146;s this really cute shoe store that has like this
little&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you&#146;re gonna do this, then
I&#146;m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So&#133; (Starts for the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I&#146;m sorry, one more thing!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (annoyed) Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, our situation. Y&#146;know umm, what we mean to each other. And I
mean we-we&#146;re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn&#146;t that,
isn&#146;t that weird?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stunned) (thinks) Well uh&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is cooking as Chandler looks on.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can&#146;t remember. Did we say we were gonna
meet here or at the movies?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We said at the movies, but&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, I&#146;ll see you there. (Starts to leave) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey! (He returns) Now that you&#146;re here&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure, I can hang out &#145;til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What
uh&#151;How come you&#146;re not going?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have a job interview I have to get ready for.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I thought you already have a job.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And people say you don&#146;t pay attention. No, this is a much better
job. It&#146;s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical
factoring for other companies.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! How do you know how to do that?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s what I do now.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Joey, come taste this.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What is it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well&#133; (Feeds him a
spoonful of what she&#146;s cooking.) I&#146;m getting my revenge!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You cooked him?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before
we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I
cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! &quot;Restaurant reviewer admits:
I was wrong about Monica.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> The front page? You really do live in your own little world,
don&#146;t ya?</p>

<p>[Scene: The Baby Furniture Store, Ross and Rachel are checking out.]</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no-no! No, no, no, we&#146;re not married.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We are having a baby together, but we&#146;re not involved. (The cashier,
a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while
ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at
him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we&#146;d like this delivered please.</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> Why don&#146;t you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! Actually, that&#146;s one of the reasons why we&#146;re not a
couple.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I chose those, I&#146;m a paleontologist.</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> Really?! That is so cool!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Oh yeah, don&#146;t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds
like he&#146;s a doctor, but he&#146;s not.</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> Oh no-no, I&#146;m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new
Walter Alvarez book?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! I&#146;m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,
and I&#146;m bored.</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> (looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood.
There&#146;s a great gym right around the corner from your building.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> That&#146;s my gym.</p>

<p><b>Cashier:</b> I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at him
confused.) A paleontologist who works out, you&#146;re like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has a
disbelieving look on her face.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I <b>am</b> like Indiana Jones.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost
got something that wasn&#146;t on the list. A whore.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started
flirting with him.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well did she know you two weren&#146;t married?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,
we-we must alert the church elders!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don&#146;t understand! You didn&#146;t see how brazen she was.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sounds like you&#146;re a little jealous.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! I&#146;m not! I-I-I just think it&#146;s wrong! It&#146;s-it&#146;s
that I&#146;m&#151;Here I am about to pop and he&#146;s out picking up some shop girl at
Sluts &#145;R&#146; Us!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Is that a real place? (Rachel&#146;s stunned) Are they hiring?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Chandler, why so fancy?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I got a job interview. It&#146;s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot
more money and I&#146;d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, I think I know someone who does that.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Me! I do that. So&#133; Seriously, do I look okay? I&#146;m little
nervous.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! You really&#151;You look great.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, just don&#146;t get your hopes up.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why not?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, the interview&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What about it?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know! You don&#146;t make a very good first impression.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shocked) What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh you don&#146;t know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, when I first met you, you were like, &quot;Blah, blah, blah.&quot;
I was like, shhh!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What is it that I do?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well it&#146;s just like you&#146;re trying too hard. Always making
jokes, y&#146;know, you just&#151;You come off a little needy.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, I&#146;m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from
you. (Gets up and hurries out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The New School, Monica, carrying her dish, and Joey are confronting the food
critic.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi! Umm, I&#146;m Monica Geller, I&#146;m the chef at Alessandro&#146;s.</p>

<p><b>The Food Critic:</b> Still?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would
like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.</p>

<p><b>The Food Critic:</b> I don&#146;t see any reason why I would do that to myself
again.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Either eat it, or be in it.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?</p>

<p><b>The Food Critic:</b> I&#146;m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a
beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks
out.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there&#146;s a new class
comin&#146; in.</p>

<p>(They start to leave.)</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start,
can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (No
one can.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has
shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon. </p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> That&#146;s very good, what&#146;s your name?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Monica.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Monica, you go to the head of the class.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (Does so.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are unpacking and setting up their new
purchases.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My son? Pretty serious. (There&#146;s a knock on the door and Ross answers
it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A
blanket.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, must&#146;ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in
your store.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job
description.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living
room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Oh uh&#133;I actually came here to ask you out.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I&#146;m just gonna put this (The
money) back in my pocket, pretend <b>that</b> didn&#146;t happen. Uh yeah, actually
I&#146;m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or&#133;</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Sure!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs
she&#146;s holding are arguing.) No! You&#146;re a horny bitch! Noooo! You&#146;re the
horny bitch! No! You&#146;re a horny bitch!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, continued from before.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So you guys go, have a really good time.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Katie) Yeah, I&#146;m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.
(Katie looks worried.) Y&#146;know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not
because I&#146;m-I&#146;m into S&amp;M. (Katie&#146;s worried again.) I&#146;m
not-I&#146;m not into anything weird. Y&#146;know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is
uncomfortable.) So, I&#146;m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel
alone.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Are you okay with this?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Okay. It was nice to see you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you
missed a button.</p>

<p><b>Katie:</b> Oh umm, actually I umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh okay, I see what you&#146;re doing there.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Phoebe are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&#146;t even believe this! I really come off that badly?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! It&#146;s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see
how really sweet and wonderful you really are.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh good. Good, because I&#146;m sure this interview is gonna last a
couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, don&#146;t <b>freak</b> out! Okay? I-I will help you. How
long before you have to leave?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> An hour.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&#146;t help you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, all right, we&#146;ll just do our best. Okay? So let&#146;s
say I&#146;m the interviewer and I&#146;m meeting you for the first time. Okay. &quot;Hi!
Come on in, I&#146;m uh, Regina Philange.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Chandler Bing.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bing, what an unusual name.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I&#146;ll let myself out.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Cooking Class, Joey is trying to cook as the teacher walks over to him.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all
your cheese?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> And the cream?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Cheese makes me thirsty.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Okay. Let&#146;s move on.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> (To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica&#146;s
station! (She tries Monica&#146;s fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing!
You&#146;ve never made this before?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no! I don&#146;t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone
what it&#146;s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Well, hats off to the chef.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I-I-I&#146;m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn&#146;t hear what
you said. Umm, hats off to who now?</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> The chef!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#146;s right.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Phoebe are still working on his
interviewing techniques.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#133;I think you&#146;ll find if I come to work here, I don&#146;t
micro-manage. I don&#146;t shy away from delegating.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um-hmm, that&#146;s good to know. But let&#146;s stop focusing on what
you don&#146;t do, and start focusing on what you do do.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (suppressing a smile) What I do do&#133;is manage to uh, create an
atmosphere of support for the people working with me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hardest thing I&#146;ve ever done in my life.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You gotta go!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! (Stands up.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, don&#146;t worry. You&#146;re ready.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you&#146;ll be
great.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Cooking Class, everyone has finished baking a batch of cookies and the
teacher is going around tasting them.]</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Ah Monica, my star student.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&#146;know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me
the star. (Hands it to her.)</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> (tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum.
(Hands the star back.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and
I&#146;m sorry, but I don&#146;t care.</p>

<p>(The teacher goes to Joey&#146;s station.)</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Okay Joey, you&#146;re up next. (Tries one of his cookies.)
This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I&#146;m a dork.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey! I&#146;m so proud of you!</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> I think you should give him your star.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Excuse me? He doesn&#146;t even know what he&#146;s doing!</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> We&#146;re all beginners here. Nobody knows what
they&#146;re doing.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I do! I&#146;m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!
It&#146;s not a courtroom drama!</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> If you&#146;re a professional chef, what are you doing
taking Introduction to Cooking?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s just that umm&#133; Well I-I cook at
this restaurant, Alessandro&#146;s, and umm I just got a really bad review&#133;</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Oh Alessandro&#146;s! I <b>love</b> that place!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You do?</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Oh yes! You&#146;re an excellent chef! As a person
you&#146;re a little&#133;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I&#146;m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Very much.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay then, I don&#146;t stink. I&#146;m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to
leave.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don&#146;t want to go. I&#146;m having fun.</p>

<p><b>The Cooking Teacher:</b> Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it&#146;s time to go, it&#146;s time to go.
(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)</p>

<p>[Scene: An Office Building, Chandler is on his interview.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#133;also I was the point person on my company&#146;s transition from
the KL-5 to GR-6 system.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> You must&#146;ve had your hands full.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That I did. That I did.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> So let&#146;s talk a little bit about your duties.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Now you&#146;ll be heading a whole division, so you&#146;ll
have a lot of duties.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (trying not to laugh) I see.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> But there&#146;ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can
dump a certain amount on them.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (really try not to laugh) Good to know.</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> We can go into detail&#133;</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No don&#146;t I beg of you!</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> All right then, we&#146;ll have a definite answer for you on
Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you&#146;ll fit in well here.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (relieved) Really?!</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did
great.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y&#146;know
I&#146;ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard
to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn&#146;t understand) Duties. (Still
doesn&#146;t.) Duties! (Still doesn&#146;t.) Poo. (Still doesn&#146;t.)</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Poo?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God this doesn&#146;t count! Okay? The interview was over, that
was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call
security! There&#146;s a crazy guy out in the hall!</p>

<p><b>The Interviewer:</b> Poo?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is returning from his date.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! You&#146;re back from your date!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How are you?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m fine, but that&#146;s not important. What&#146;s important is
how was she?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What&#146;s uh, what&#146;s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No, she&#146;s&#151;She was nice. I mean, she&#146;s a little
slutty, but who isn&#146;t?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I liked her.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you
Indiana Jones!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! It&#146;s just that, Kate bothered me. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why? What was wrong with her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, so what&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t want you to date her!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I
don&#146;t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it&#146;s a terrible thing to
even think this, and it&#146;s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my
constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I&#146;m very sorry, but that is just the way that
I feel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I won&#146;t date. I&#146;ll uh, I&#146;ll be here, with you, all the
time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? But I&#146;m being so unreasonable.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> True, but you&#146;re allowed to be unreasonable. You&#146;re having our
baby.</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you feel better?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, not really. You&#146;re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I
have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh Rach?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Just one thing umm&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> We live together. You&#146;re having our baby. I&#146;m not gonna see
anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don&#146;t want something more?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (pause) Wow! I don&#146;t know, maybe. I&#146;m&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin&#146; around! (She&#146;s stunned) Like you
did last night when I had to pee?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin&#146; with you too!
</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no-no-no-no, no!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#133;that you actually&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No that&#146;s just&#151;(Laughs)&#151;That&#146;s just &#145;cause
I&#146;m such a good messer!</p>

<p>(They both laugh. Ross sits down, but Rachel doesn&#146;t move and is lost in thought.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The bathroom?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The New School, Joey and Monica are walking down a hallway.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that&#146;s
the first A I&#146;ve gotten since seventh grade, <b>and</b> I didn&#146;t have to sleep
with the teacher this time.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What the hell!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They enter.)</p>

<p><b>The Acting Teacher:</b> All right, let&#146;s start with some basics. Can anybody
tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?</p>

<p>(No one can and Monica looks at Joey expectantly.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)</p>
