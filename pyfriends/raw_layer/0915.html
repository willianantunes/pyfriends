[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Ross, Monica and Phoebe are there as Chandler enters]<p>
<B>Chandler</B>: (<I>excited</I>) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>shocked</I>) Really? (<I>She looks around, suddenly embarrassed</I>) Let's get past the moment.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: What's your news?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (<I>Everybody cheers</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>hugging Chandler</I>) Oh, honey, that's incredible!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>inquisitive</I>) Gosh, what's the pay like? (<I>Everybody stares at her indignantly</I>) Oh, come on people&#133; (<I>defending</I>) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (<I>She looks at Joey</I>) Hey Joey! (<I>Joey winks at her</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. <br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Right. So, it'll be the same except&#133; less sex with you. (<I>Joey nods</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>enthusiastic</I>) That's great.<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating <br>
<br>
(<I>At the same time, Gunther puts down a cup of coffee in front of Chandler</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: (<I>grinning awkwardly</I>) Humiliating and noble!<br>
<br>
(<I>Gunther shoots a nasty look at him while leaving</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Ross, you did not come up with &quot;got milk?&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Yes, I <B>did</B>, I <B>did</B>! (<I>He turns to Joey, disappointed</I>) I should have written it down!<br>

<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>entering</I>) Hey!<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Hey!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (<I>Monica smiles</I>) ... and I smelled bacon. (<I>taking some</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: He just left.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>puzzled</I>) Who did? (<I>Monica looks bewildered</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: (<I>entering</I>) Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>standing up, surprised</I>) She did?<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: (<I>enthusiastic</I>) You got it!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>still surprised</I>) I did?<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: What is she talking about?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: I don't know, but it sounds great. <br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Your agent called. You got that audition.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: With Lennart Haze?<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Yes.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway&#133; and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Is it a good play?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. <br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Yeah, yeah, and directing.<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>sighs</I>) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. <br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: (<I>disbelieving</I>) You saw that?<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: No, but&#133; I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel and Joey</B>: (<I>pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces</I>) Ah!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Yeah, he's done some amazing works.<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>almost laughing</I>) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (<I>They all laugh</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>sitting down</I>) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Chandler's new workplace, his fellow interns are already seated around a table]<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: (<I>entering</I>) Good morning, everybody.<br>
<br>
<B>Intern</B>: Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys&#133; except for the tie, the briefcase&#133; and the fact that I can rent a car.<br>
<br>
<B>Intern</B>: Seriously, you're an intern?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.<br>
<br>
<B>Intern</B>: (<I>shaking his head disbelievingly</I>) Dude!<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (<I>he sits down</I>) <br>
<br>
(<I>Everybody gives him an inquiring look</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: The comedian? USO?!<br>
<br>
<B>Intern</B>: (<I>correcting him</I>) Uhm, it's USA, sir.<br>
<br>
(<I>Chandler desperately covers his head in his hands</I>)<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Audition room, Joey is lead into the room by a receptionist in a fancy dress]<br>
<br>
<B>Receptionist</B>: This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze. <br>
<br>
(<I>Lennart Haze turns around in his chair to face Joey</I>) <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: It is so amazing to meet you. (<I>They are shaking hands</I>) I'm such a big fan of your work.<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Well, I've&#133; I've been blessed with a&#133; a lot of great roles. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Tell me about it! &quot;Unlimited nights and weekends!&quot; <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. (<I>He stands up and walks menacingly towards Joey</I>) I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Really?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>regaining confidence</I>) Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Peeeeeooooooooch (<I>He mimes flying out of the cannon</I>) &quot;Hang up that phone!&quot; One take!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Wow!<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: So, shall we read?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Oh, yah, sure.<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it? <br>
<br>
(<I>Joey nods whereupon Lennart acts as if he is entering a room</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;What the hell are you still doing here&quot;?<br>
<br>
(<I>Joey stares at him, fascinated by his performance</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Err, &quot;I think you know&quot;. <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;Bastard&quot;!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: &quot;I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;Go, go!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: &quot;I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say &quot;long pause&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>understandingly</I>) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a&#133; (<I>He mimes wearing a feather on his head</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern (<I>He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent</I>) &quot;I could go right now, maaan!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: (<I>stunned, muttering</I>) My god in heaven. <br>
<br>
(<I>The producers stand up</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Producer #1</B>: Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?<br>
<br>
(<I>They stand aside, talking</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. (<I>Joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression</I>). <br>
<br>
(<I>Producer #1 whispers something</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. (<I>Joey smiles smugly at this</I>) This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.<br>
<br>
(<I>Joey approaches them</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>interrupting their conversation</I>) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: (<I>to Producer #1)</I> 'How you doing?' (<I>to Lennart again</I>) You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: I really doubt that. <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: (<I>explaining to Joey, who nods </I>fervently) No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you. <br>
<br>
(<I>Joey ponders on this for a while</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (suggesting) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Backstreet, Ross and Phoebe walking]<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Oh, I hear divorce bells. <br>
<br>
(<I>A mugger, his face hidden by a cap, approaches them from behind</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Mugger</B>: Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>taken aback</I>) What?<br>
<br>
<B>Mugger</B>: I have a gun (<I>It looks like he has a gun under his coat</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. (<I>He searches his coat and freaks out</I>). Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. <br>
<br>
(<I>He finally finds the wallet and hands it to the mugger</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Mugger</B>: Alright, lady, now give me your purse!<B><br>
</B><br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: No.<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>still in a high-pitched voice</I>) What do you mean &quot;no&quot;? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. <br>
<br>
(<I>A sign of recognition runs across Phoebe's face</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Lowell, is that you?<br>
<br>
<B>Lowell</B>: Phoebe? (<I>He lifts his cap</I>) Oh my god!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>simultaneously</I>) Oh my god! <br>
<br>
(<I>They hug and scream</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>excited</I>) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.<br>
<br>
<B>Lowell</B>: Ross, nice to meet you. (<I>He stretches his hand out to him</I>) <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Yeah, a real pleasure.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Ah, it's been so long, so long. (<I>They hug again</I>) I can't believe you're still doing this!<br>
<br>
<B>Lowell</B>: Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Good for you! <br>
<br>
<B>Lowell</B>: So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Ouh&#133; (<I>she nods</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>shocked</I>) Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up&#133;<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits on the couch as Joey enters]<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Hey, how did the audition go? <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. (<I>He sits down</I>) <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: What happened?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: So far so good! (<I>Joey nods</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: (<I>entering, carrying a large box</I>) Honey, I'm old!<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>standing up, walking towards him</I>) What's wrong?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (<I>He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Wooooooooow (<I>He takes the sneaker</I>) It's like they're on fire!<br>
<I><br>
<B>Monica</B>: What are they? (They sit down again)<br>
</I><br>
<B>Chandler</B>: They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>determined</I>) I give you $ 500 for them!<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: What am I supposed to do with these?<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Well, first of all, they're not called &quot;sneakers&quot; anymore. Apparently, they're called &quot;kicks&quot; or &quot;skids&quot; and I think I heard somebody say &quot;slorps&quot;. (<I>He takes a sneaker</I>) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (<I>to Monica</I>) Would you help me try to sell these?<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? <br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? <br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk, Monica sits on the couch as Phoebe and Ross enter]<br>
<br>
<B>All</B>: Hey, hey!<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Hey, you'll never guess what just happened&#133; Phoebe and I got mugged!<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: You okay?!<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>sitting down</I>) Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>bewildered</I>) How do you know a mugger?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: You wanna know how she knew him? (<I>He points at Phoebe</I>) Because Phoebe used to mug people. <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>shocked</I>) Seriously?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know&#133; sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>disapproving</I>) Phoebe, that is awful!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony&#133; I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: You're mother killed herself!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: She was a drug dealer!<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because (<I>menacingly</I>) I was about to do some serious damage! <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>laughing</I>) Okay&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Why?<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>worried</I>) You were?<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics&#133; you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: (<I>coughing</I>) Wonderwoman!<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone&#133; (<I>He looks at Monica</I>) &#133; when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: &quot;Gimme your money, punk!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>shocked</I>) Oh my god&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: &quot;Science Boy&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: A superhuman thirst for knowledge.<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: That's it. <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Well, I-I better get to class (<I>He stands up</I>) Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: No&#133; actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street&#133; that's where stabby Joe works. <br>
<br>
(Ross leaves Central Perk)<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Okay, I think we have a problem here. <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: What?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Yeah?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: So?<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B> <B>and</B> <B>Monica</B>: &quot;Geology rocks!&quot; <br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Oh my god!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: I know&#133; I mugged Ross! <br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Audition room, the producers and Lennart are waiting for Joey]<br>
<br>
<B>Receptionist</B>: You're late!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>entering</I>) I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?<br>
<br>
<B>Receptionist</B>: No, Lennart doesn't wait!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: But I'm bursting with u-hu!<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: (<I>spotting Joey</I>) Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Actually, I really need&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: (<I>interrupting</I>) We must go now, quickly, please.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Yes&#133; ahahaaa (<I>He seems to be in pain</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Ready? &quot;What the hell are you still doing here?&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>walking on the spot</I>) &quot;I think you know!&quot; <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;Oh, you sick bastard!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: &quot;I am what you made me! You know what?&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: &quot;I could go right now.&quot; <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;Then go, go!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>urgent</I>) &quot;I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Cut! That was good. (<I>He turns to the producers</I>) That was very good. You did everything I asked for. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>disbelieving</I>) I did? <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Yes. Plus&#133; what you've got that&#133; I don't know what you've got going&#133; this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but &#150; you know what? &#150; more, more. Can you do that?<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. (<I>He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: (<I>watching Joey leave</I>) Look at that: still in character, I like it&#133; I plant seeds I can't explain.<br>

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Chander sits on the couch as Monica and Rachel enter]<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: Hey!<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Hey!<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: What are you doing?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Putting on the sneakers&#133; thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Oh, anything yet?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!<br>
<br>
(<I>At that moment, Joey opens the door</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>entering</I>) Hey!<br>
<br>
<B>All</B>: Hey! <br>
<br>
(<I>Joey heads straight for the fridge, takes all the beverage cans and is about to leave the apartment</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Probably wanna know what I'm doing&#133;?<br>
<br>
<B>Monica</B>: No, that seems about right.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Joey, that was formula.<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: We gotta get more of that. (<I>He leaves the apartment</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: (<I>sitting on the couch</I>) You know what&#133; these aren't half-bad! (<I>to Rachel</I>) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.<br>
<br>
<B>Rachel</B>: Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. <br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Alright (<I>He stands wearing the sneakers on</I>) I feel youger already! <br>
<br>
(<I>He trips and falls hard on his back</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: (<I>on the floor</I>) Yah, I think I broke my hip.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there drinking coffee and Ross is about to enter]<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>spotting Ross</I>) Hey, you!<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Hey!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Hey, how was class?<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: No one ever asked me that, what's wrong? <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Nothing, I really wanna know.<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Oh&#133; (<I>He looks positively surprised</I>) Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>interrupting</I>) Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make&#133; uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: No, it wasn't.<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Yes, it was. <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>interrupting, pinching his year</I>) &quot;Gimme your money, punk!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>shocked</I>) Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you&#133; you mugged me? <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: (<I>apologetic</I>) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. (<I>She smiles at him, but he doesn't understand</I>) I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have&#133; have a great one! <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: It's not the best!<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (indignant) There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Really? Even more humiliating than&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>interrupting</I>) Hey, let's not do this! <br>
<br>
(<I>He picks up his briefcase and walks out of the door, leaving Phoebe behind</I>)<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Chandler's new workplace, we are witnessing a presentation of a fellow intern]<br>
<br>
<B>Intern</B>: &#133; and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!<br>
<br>
<B>Boss</B>: (<I>ironic</I>) That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? (C<I>h</I>andler <I>raises his hand</I>) Chander&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Okay&#133; (<I>He stands up</I>) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Intern</B>: (snorting) Your age?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know&#133; maybe he falls&#133; maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: &quot;Not suitable for adults!&quot; <br>
<br>
<B>Boss</B>: Chandler, that's great! <br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: Oh, thank you, sir&#133; or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (<I>He sits down again</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Boss</B>: You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's&#133;. (<I>enthusiastic</I>) You did you come up with that?<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: (over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.<br>
<br>
<B>Boss</B>: That is great. Good work!<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>. Thank you. <br>
<br>
<B>Boss</B>: See all of you tomorrow. (<I>He leaves</I>)<br>
<br>
(Chandler stands up and walks out the room with a cane)<br>
<br>
<B>Chandler</B>: The cold weather hurts my hip!<br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross sits in a chair as Phoebe enters]<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Hey, Ross! (<I>He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her</I>) I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. (<I>He raises his hands as if being mugged</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: I just really wanted to apologize again and&#133; and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. <br>
<br>
(She puts a box on her lap, labelled &quot;crap from the street&quot;) <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>faking enthusiasm</I>) Oh my god, crap from the street? (<I>She smiles excitedly, but Ross just turns back to his newspaper</I>) <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell&#133; or smoke. (<I>Ross looks at her in astonishment</I>) Anyway, I was looking through it and I found &quot;Science Boy&quot; (<I>She holds up some sheets of paper</I> <I>and hands them to Ross</I>)<br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Oh my god. (<I>He sighs</I>) I never thought I'd see this again. (<I>He browses trough the pages</I>) It's all here. What made you save it all these years? <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: I can't say, I just thought it was really good&#133; and&#133; maybe would be worth something some day. <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: You really thought &quot;Science Boy&quot; was worth saving! <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: Yeah&#133; but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: Still&#133; this is amazing&#133; Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. <br>
<br>
<B>Phoebe</B>: You're welcome. And thank you for &quot;Science Boy&quot;. I learned a lot from him <br>
<br>
<B>Ross</B>: You're welcome. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Scene: Audition room, Joey and Lennart are rehearsing]<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>hoping frantically on the spot, screaming</I>) &quot;I need an answer!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know.&quot;<br>

<B>Joey</B>: &quot;I need an answer now!&quot; <br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;Alright, here, you want an answer&#133; the answer&#133; is&#133;&quot;<br>
<br>
(<I>He pauses while Joey struggles to avoid wetting his pants</I>) <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>screaming</I>) Oh!<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: &quot;She never loved me, she only loved you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: &quot;You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for &#150; Bang &#150; End Scene!&quot;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Absolutely amazing! (<I>The producers applaud Joey</I>) The part is yours. <br>
<br>
<B>Joey</B>: (<I>in pain</I>) Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get&#133;<br>
<br>
<B>Lennart</B>: Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! (<I>He hugs Joey</I>) You can relax now. Yeah.<br>
<br>
(<I>Joey relaxes and wets his pants while hugging Lennart</I>)<br>

<br>
<B>Ross</B>: (<I>entering</I>) Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that&#133;<br>
