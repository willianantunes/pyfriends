<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, everyone is there as Joey enters happily.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, we have been through this before!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Don&#146;t do this to yourself.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She&#146;s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well all right then, I guess I shouldn&#146;t get to excited about the
fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You serious?!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s great!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah well, we&#146;ll see.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You kissed her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh we kissed it up real nice.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you kissed her, so what happened after that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I came over here to tell you guys.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So she&#146;s just waiting over there for ya?</p>

<p>(Joey nods yes, but suddenly realizes what he did and runs out of the apartment and
back to his place.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Janine are pretty much making out at one of the tables
as Monica and Rachel look on from the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I gotta go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I&#146;m gonna be really late for dance class!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Okay, now I&#146;m really late. (Gets up.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, I&#146;m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
(She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> (to Monica and Rachel) Bye.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye. (Janine exits.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Have you kissed her yet? It&#146;s awesome! I could do it forever!
Y&#146;know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am <b>so</b> glad you said cooks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have <b>got</b> to tell the
post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh, <i>Pottery Barn</i>! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds
the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m not your garbage man. I&#146;m your mailman.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows
her the picture.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You got it from <i>Pottery Barn</i>?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! It&#146;s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an
apothecary is?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, Phoebe hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I hate <i>Pottery Barn</i> too. They kicked me out of there just because I
sat on a bed!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (indignant) I was tired!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should
have a history, a story behind it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> It&#146;s gotta be one of a kind. Y&#146;know like umm, y&#146;know uh,
what&#146;s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! I made that for her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You made pottery?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I&#146;m telling&#151;If you put that in her apartment you&#146;ll never
hear the end of it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay fine! I&#146;ll-I&#146;ll just tell her it&#146;s an antique
apothecary table, she doesn&#146;t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this
little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore&#133;</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway between the apartments, Joey, Janine, Chandler, and Monica are
returning from a double date. Chandler is telling a joke.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> &#133;so then the farmer says, &quot;That&#146;s not a cow and
you&#146;re not milking it.&quot; (Everyone laughs.) </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking
for a couple to go out with and now we have one!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look at us, we&#146;re a couple of couples!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And Chandler I can&#146;t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug
and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I&#146;ll make that pasta thing
I was telling you about.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Oh that would be great!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, you don&#146;t have too!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get
the wine right?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See ya tomorrow!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Tomorrow!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Can&#146;t wait! (They each go into their respective apartments.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey and Janine&#146;s.]</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> How are we gonna get out of that one?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I can&#146;t handle two nights in a row with them.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What-what&#146;s wrong with Monica and Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I don&#146;t know, they&#146;re just a little blah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Blah?!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Well y&#146;know, he&#146;s blah, she&#146;s just&#151;she&#146;s very
loud for such a small person.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, they&#146;re like my best friends. Are you saying we can&#146;t hang
out with them? &#145;Cause that would kinda be a problem.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y&#146;know, not two
nights in a row. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I guess.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Thank you. (They kiss.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you want, I&#146;ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you
presents.</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is placing CDs into her antique apothecary table as
Phoebe returns home.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Guess!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, a flea market?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ha! See, I knew, I knew you&#146;d get it on the first guess. Isn&#146;t
it cool! It&#146;s an apothecary table.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She&#146;s opening and
closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Almost.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How much was it?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> It was only 500 bucks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 500 bucks at a flea market?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was
new, y&#146;know like back then.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y&#146;know, it was
like a dollar.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> A dollar?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, what period is it from?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, it&#146;s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y&#146;know?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, yes I do. God, oh it&#146;s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great
story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y&#146;know where it was from
or&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, Rachel is entering as Ross comes out of the kitchen
carrying popcorn.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! We&#146;re here!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You like it? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> It&#146;s my new apothecary table!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Phoebe&#146;s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well why not?! She&#146;ll-she&#146;ll love it! It&#146;s the real thing!
I got it at <i>Pottery Barn</i>.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table
she&#146;s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why did you do that?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because she hates<i> Pottery Barn</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>?!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know! I know, she says it&#146;s all mass-produced, nothing is
authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come
on, she&#146;s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!
Please?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe&#151;Ooh, although I did
get some great <i>Pottery Barn</i> sheets! (Gets them.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, yeah! I still can&#146;t believe she hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, get over it! It&#146;s not like she hates you.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah but <i>Pottery Barn</i>! Y&#146;know what I think? It&#146;s just
she-she&#146;s weird. Y&#146;know it&#146;s because she&#146;s a twin. Twins are weird.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, she&#146;s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a
kind.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh. Y&#146;know what&#146;s not one of a kind? A twin!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, Phoebe&#146;s here! Okay, let&#146;s turn out all the lights and
we&#146;ll just watch the movie!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Hey&#151;Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.) </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He got it a flea market!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen
the purse strings a little.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Janine&#146;s, Joey is pacing around as Chandler and Monica enter.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands
it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn&#146;t afford it,
because you paid dinner last night.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it&#146;s just gonna be me again tonight.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What happened to Janine?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, she&#146;s uh-uh really sick.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&#146;s too bad.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she&#146;s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high
fever, a nose problem&#133; Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> (entering from her room) Monica! Chandler! I&#146;m really-really sorry
about tonight. I don&#146;t know if Joey told you; I just couldn&#146;t get out of going
to this play. I&#146;m sorry. Have a great time.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> &#145;Kay!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Bye. (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s funny, I saw no phlegm.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Janine&#146;s, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, she really is sick!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then why-why is she going to a play?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, y&#146;know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well uh, she didn&#146;t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a
row. I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are
too loud.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was
lying to our faces?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could
not have been nicer to her!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I am not blah, I am a hoot!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don&#146;t-don&#146;t be
mad. I&#146;m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys
are like my best friends! Y&#146;know? And it was our first date! Plus, she&#146;s really
sick!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you sh&#151;No you said you made that up!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, but don&#146;t you think the sick thing is way better than the
play thing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh, they&#146;re both good. I generally just go with, Monica&#146;s
drunk again. (Monica glares at him.) </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?
She&#146;ll come around I promise.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>

<p>(They exit and close the door.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (from the hallway) I do <b>not</b> like that woman!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shouting) I can hear you!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I <b>am</b> loud!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are watching a movie.]</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Aww! (They all laugh.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross&#146;s table.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new&#133;(On
Rachel&#146;s glare)&#133;old sheet?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her
which spills the wine.) Noo!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> My apothecary table!!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same
apothecary table they have.) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ross, where did you get this?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I got it at <i>Pottery Barn</i>!! Okay?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, Phoebe, <i>Pottery Barn</i> has ripped off the design of our
antique!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Oh my God, well if they&#146;ve ripped off our table ours must be
much more than one and fifty dollars!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yes.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well this doesn&#146;t even smell like opium.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for
wrecking my sheet by the way.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh Ross, calm down, I&#146;ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at
Rachel)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are sitting at the kitchen table.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, one more time.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Perfect decibel.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (loudly) I know!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So uh, what are you guys doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh nothing, we&#146;re just talking. Y&#146;know, blah-blah-blah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I
came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I&#146;d like to but, (extremely quietly) I&#146;m not sure we
have time to go.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ha-ha, very funny&#151;Look! I don&#146;t know what to do! I really want
you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We owe you?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your
relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like
an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> We didn&#146;t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,
&quot;No!&quot;)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> You don&#146;t think I know that!</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is showing Ross around the newly decorated living
room.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &#133;see I can&#146;t decide whether it would go better next to the new
wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! I didn&#146;t know that there was a <i>Pottery Barn</i> up here.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I know. I went a little crazy.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!
The ornamental bird cage! Large!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early
Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial
times.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ah!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other
time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well there&#146;s yore. And uh, y&#146;know, yesteryear.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah no, I&#146;m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this
stuff. Ross, y&#146;know if you ever decide you need to redecorate&#151;And I think that
you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey he doesn&#146;t need my help.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, come on! I think he&#146;s ready to get rid of, what did you call
it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y&#146;know what? Since you have such a great
sense of what I need, uh ooh, here&#146;s-here&#146;s 60 bucks, why don&#146;t you take
Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (not sure of what to do) Y&#146;know what? I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t
think Phoebe really wants to come.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! I do want to!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, she does want to.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She does want to.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Street, Phoebe and Rachel are heading back from that Colonial flea market.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I don&#146;t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just
better last time.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p>(They walk by a <i>Pottery Barn</i> window display.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uck, look at this! <i>Pottery Barn</i>, yuck!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, y&#146;know what? Don&#146;t look at it. (Realizes the display is
their living room) Seriously, don&#146;t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Look-look! There&#146;s the coffee table they stole from us!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, those bastards! Let&#146;s go.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the&#133;wait a
sec! This is our exact living room!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No! No! No it&#146;s not! No it&#146;s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is
totally different! I mean we don&#146;t have the&#133; (Looks desperately for something
different.) We don&#146;t have the&#133;that lamp! And-and that screen is y&#146;know, on
the other side.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, <i>Pottery Barn</i>! Oh
my God!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! Okay-okay look&#151;no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about <i>Pottery Barn</i>. Just&#133; Come on don&#146;t be mad.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that
is wrong with the world! And it&#146;s all sitting up in my living room and all I can
think about is how I don&#146;t have that lamp!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&#146;t! I can&#146;t! Unless&#133; Well are you saying that-that
you would move out if-if I didn&#146;t buy that lamp?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! No! I&#146;m not gonna move out!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But are you saying that you would move out if I didn&#146;t buy that
lamp?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would <b>so</b> move out!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay then I don&#146;t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s right!</p>

<p>(They start to go inside.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But at least the apothecary table is real.</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Joey, Janine, Monica, and Chandler are returning from their second
date.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, this-this-this was great. Didn&#146;t everybody have a great time?</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I&#146;ve got to say, I&#146;m
sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous
or something.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#146;s totally understandable.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Don&#146;t worry about it.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> So we can go out again?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Oh good.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh well then, good night!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey and Janine&#146;s, they&#146;re entering.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See? Eh, wasn&#146;t that fun?</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> We have <b>got</b> to move!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (bursting in) I <b>knew</b> it!! Y&#146;know, you&#146;re not so quiet
yourself, missy!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I&#146;m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching
modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) &quot;Oh Chandler,
I just lost myself in the moment.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Y&#146;know, I know you&#146;re talking, but all I hear is, &quot;Blah.
Blah. Blah-blah-blah.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let&#146;s go! Right
now!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and
Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Y&#146;know I think you can take her.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Janine) You&#146;d better hope I don&#146;t see you in the hallway!!
(They exit.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, uh, we&#146;ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people
are my friends; you can&#146;t treat them that way.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> They said stuff to me too, y&#146;know!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! I know! And I&#146;m going to talk to them about it. They mean so
much to me. They&#133; They&#146;re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all
the time, I-I&#133; I don&#146;t think we can be together. It just, it just can&#146;t
work. It can&#146;t. (Starts to break up) I&#146;m very upset.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her
and she exits into the hallway.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the hallway, Janine is entering as Monica is taking out the garbage.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What did I tell you about the hall?!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I&#146;d
really like it if we could be friends.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I&#146;m glad we worked things
out.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> I&#146;ll see you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> (muttering to herself) Or I&#146;ll hear you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (hearing that) That&#146;s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with
the garbage bag) Come on!</p>

<p><b>Janine:</b> Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (chasing her) You&#146;d better run! </p>

<p>(Joey and Chandler both come into the hallway.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did you hear that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&#146;m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! (They head downstairs.)</p>
