<p>[Scene: Chandler's office in Tulsa.&nbsp;&nbsp; His assistant is showing him photographs.]</p>
<p>JO LYNN: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy
    in the cat condo is Jinkies.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Yep.&nbsp; That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.&nbsp; Single are ya?</p>
<p>(Phone rings.&nbsp; Chandler answers using the speaker phone.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Chandler Bing.</p>
<p>JOEY: Hey.&nbsp; How come you're answering your own phone?&nbsp; Where's your crazy assistant?</p>
<p>(She frowns.&nbsp; Chandler picks up the hand set.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: What's up Joe?</p>
<p>JOEY: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?</p>
<p>JOEY: No, no, no.&nbsp; When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to
    be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .&nbsp; courtside!</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Courtside?&nbsp; Oh my God.</p>
<p>JOEY: Yeah.&nbsp; Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with
    his knee.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: That's so cool.&nbsp; I'll let Monica know.</p>
<p>(Chandler hangs up and calls Monica who is reading a book on their sofa as
    the phone rings.)</p>
<p>MONICA: Hello?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Joey just called.&nbsp; He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and
    me tomorrow night.</p>
<p>MONICA: Really?&nbsp; But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.&nbsp;
    If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: But hey, it's courtside.&nbsp; The cheerleaders are going to be right
    in fr. . . (Pause)&nbsp; That's not the way to convince you. </p>
<p>MONICA: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You
    can't go to the game.&nbsp; You have to spend time with me."&nbsp; So, if you could just
    realize it on your own . . . </p>
<p>CHANDLER: I know.&nbsp; You're right.&nbsp; I want to see you too.&nbsp; I've just got to
    figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?&nbsp; He's really looking forward to this.</p>
<p>MONICA: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.&nbsp; Tell him
    that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.&nbsp; Tell him that
    what little time we have is precious.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Yeah, ah, ah . . .&nbsp; I'll think of something.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center">OPENING CREDITS</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.&nbsp; Ross is in the living room covering Emma.&nbsp;
    Rachel enters wearing a sexy dress.]</p>
<p>ROSS: Wow!&nbsp; (pause)&nbsp; Wow, You look . . . uh . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just, ah . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; That
    dress . . . uh . . .&nbsp; </p>
<p>RACHEL: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.</p>
<p>ROSS: Well, well, they're good.&nbsp; It's been a while since I've seen you like
    this.&nbsp; You, you clean up good.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh well, well thank you.&nbsp; (She laughs.&nbsp; He stares for a moment.)&nbsp; Okay,
    stop.&nbsp; Stop looking at me like that.&nbsp; The last time <b>that</b> happened, (points
    to Ross) <b>that</b> happened.&nbsp; (points to Emma.)</p>
<p>ROSS: Oh right, right.&nbsp; (They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks
    away.)&nbsp; So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night
    away from Emma?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Yeah, yeah.&nbsp; Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.&nbsp; And thank
    you for watching the baby, by the way.</p>
<p>ROSS: Oh, it's fine.&nbsp; Actually, I, I invited Mike over.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Phoebe's Mike?</p>
<p>ROSS: Yeah.</p>
<p>RACHEL: I didn't know you guys hung out.</p>
<p>ROSS: We don't.&nbsp; But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.&nbsp; You know,
    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh that's so cute:&nbsp; Ross and Mike's first date.&nbsp; Is that going to be
    awkward?&nbsp; I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?</p>
<p>ROSS: I don't know.&nbsp; But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.&nbsp;
    He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.&nbsp; He's been divorced; I have <b>some</b>
    experience in that area.</p>
<p>(Rachel nods.&nbsp; There is a knock on the door.)</p>
<p>RACHEL: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Phoebe and Mike enter.)</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Hi</p>
<p>RACHEL: Hey.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (spotting Rachel's dress) Oooh.&nbsp; Girl's night out indeed.</p>
<p>RACHEL: (to Ross) Ok.&nbsp; So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,
    but if you need anything Ross . . . </p>
<p>ROSS: Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?&nbsp; You go have fun.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Okay.&nbsp; You too.&nbsp; And I hope you score.&nbsp; (to Mike) Bye.</p>
<p>MIKE: Bye.</p>
<p>ROSS: So . . .&nbsp; Welcome.</p>
<p>MIKE: (Holds up a six pack of Foster's Lager) I got beer.</p>
<p>ROSS: I got bottled breast milk.</p>
<p>MIKE: Eh, why don't we start with the beer?</p>
<p>ROSS: Okay.&nbsp; (They sit.)&nbsp; So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.</p>
<p>MIKE: Yeah.</p>
<p>ROSS: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.</p>
<p>MIKE: Ah?&nbsp; (pause)&nbsp; Do you have one here?</p>
<p>ROSS: No.</p>
<p>MIKE: Okay.&nbsp; (pause)</p>
<p>(They clink beer bottles, and drink.&nbsp; Then, they stare uncomfortably at their
    bottles.)</p>
<p>ROSS: Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.&nbsp; Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe
    said you . . . You've been divorced?</p>
<p>MIKE: Yeah.&nbsp; (pause)&nbsp; Yeah, I'm sorry.&nbsp; I don't . . . I don't really like to
    talk about it.</p>
<p>ROSS: (pause) That's okay.&nbsp; We'll talk about (pause) something else.&nbsp; (They
    pause.&nbsp; They drink.)</p>
<p>MIKE:&nbsp; So, you're a paleontologist, right?</p>
<p>ROSS: Yeah.</p>
<p>MIKE: My cousin's a paleontologist.</p>
<p>ROSS: Ah?&nbsp; (Mike nods.&nbsp; Another pause.)&nbsp; Well, he and I would probably have
    a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>[Scene:&nbsp; Monica and Chandler's apartment.&nbsp; Monica is wearing a sexy negligee.&nbsp;
    She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.&nbsp;
    He sets the case by the door.]</p>
<p>MONICA: Hi.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Hey.</p>
<p>MONICA: Welcome home.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to
    Monica.)&nbsp; Oh well, look at you.</p>
<p>MONICA: Yeah.&nbsp; What do you think?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Well, it looks great.&nbsp; It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the
    same thing underneath.&nbsp; So . . .</p>
<p>MONICA: Oh.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: See what I mean . . . (They kiss.)</p>
<p>(There is a loud thud at the door.)</p>
<p>JOEY: Hey!&nbsp; How come the door's locked?</p>
<p>MONICA: Just a second.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (hushed) No, no, no, no, no.&nbsp; Joey can't know that I'm here.</p>
<p>MONICA: Why not?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks
    game.&nbsp; So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.</p>
<p>MONICA: So, you lied to him?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Achhh.&nbsp; It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.&nbsp;
    (pause)&nbsp; Except with you.</p>
<p>JOEY: Hey!&nbsp; Open the door.&nbsp; What's going on?&nbsp; (He knocks.)</p>
<p>(Monica goes to the door.&nbsp; Chandler slides behind it as she opens it slightly.)</p>
<p>JOEY: What are you . ..&nbsp; (He sees her in her negligee.)&nbsp; Why are you dressed
    like that?</p>
<p>MONICA: Oh, because, um . . .&nbsp; well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple
    of days.&nbsp; So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.</p>
<p>JOEY: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.</p>
<p>MONICA: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.&nbsp; You know,
    like, "Hi, How do I look?"&nbsp; (As Chandler) "Really sexy.&nbsp; Could I BE any more
    turned on?"</p>
<p>JOEY: Okay.&nbsp; (pause.&nbsp; He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)&nbsp;
    Whoa, whoa.&nbsp; Why are there two glasses of wine out?</p>
<p>MONICA: Because. . .&nbsp; one of them is for you.</p>
<p>(Monica turns to get the wine.&nbsp; Chandler peeps through the peephole.&nbsp; Joey,
    seeing something, peeps back.&nbsp; Chandler ducks.&nbsp; Monica returns with two glasses
    of wine.&nbsp; She gives one to Joey.)</p>
<p>MONICA: Cheers.&nbsp; (She clinks his glass and pulls back.)&nbsp; Okay, buh-bye.&nbsp; (She
    closes the door.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: You know, it's funny.&nbsp; I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction
    myself.&nbsp; (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and
    wiggles it.)&nbsp; Hi ya.</p>
<p>MONICA: You might want to keep practicing.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Yah.</p>
<p>(Chandler's cell phone rings.&nbsp; He looks at it.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: It's Joey.&nbsp; (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear
    too.)&nbsp; Hey Joe.</p>
<p>JOEY: Dude, come home!</p>
<p>CHANDLER: What? Why?</p>
<p>JOEY: COME . . .&nbsp; HOME.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Look I, I can't.&nbsp; What's going on?</p>
<p>JOEY: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin'
    on ya.&nbsp; I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Monica look at each other.&nbsp; Chandler nods.)</p>
<p>JOEY: All right look.&nbsp; (He walks to the hallway.)&nbsp; If you can't come home and
    deal with this, then I'm gonna.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: NO!</p>
<p>JOEY: (outside the apartment door) I just heard him!</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?</p>
<p>JOEY: (listens at the door.)&nbsp; No.&nbsp; (pause) All right, I'm going in.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: No! Wait!</p>
<p>JOEY: I heard him again!</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (writhes as if in agony) All right, look.&nbsp; Just stay there.&nbsp; I'm
    coming home.</p>
<p>JOEY: Okay.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; I'll see you when you get here.&nbsp; I'm gonna wait out in
    the hall in case the dude comes out.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Is that really necessary?</p>
<p>JOEY: Absolutely.&nbsp; You'd do it for me.&nbsp; Not that you ever have to because I
    know how to keep my women satisfied.</p>
<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.&nbsp; Mike is blowing a note from his beer
    bottle.&nbsp; Ross stares off to the side.]</p>
<p>ROSS: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?&nbsp; I mean, they said thirty minutes
    or less.&nbsp; Well, how long has it been?</p>
<p>MIKE: (looking at his watch) Eleven minutes.&nbsp; (long pause)&nbsp; And now twelve.&nbsp;
    So, do you like the beer?</p>
<p>ROSS: I do.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; Although, it's actually a lager.</p>
<p>MIKE: huh.&nbsp; (pause)&nbsp; What's the difference between beer and lager?</p>
<p>ROSS: I don't know.&nbsp; We could look it up.</p>
<p>MIKE: (nods) Things are about to get wild.</p>

<p>[Scene: A bar.&nbsp; Rachel and Phoebe are bringing their drinks from the bar to a sofa.]</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh God.&nbsp; Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around
    talking about you and Ross?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh God.&nbsp; It seems like forever ago.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: I know.&nbsp; (sighs)&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what's going on with you and Ross?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Well, um . . . I don't know.&nbsp; I mean, for a long time nothing.&nbsp; But
    you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah
    . . . little thing.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Oh my God!&nbsp; I love things.&nbsp; What happened?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.&nbsp; And, ah, then we
    had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Eye-contact?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: I hope you were using protection.</p>
<p>WAITER: (with tray and two drinks)&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; Um, these are from the two
    gentlemen at the end of the bar.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh.&nbsp; (to Phoebe) Should we send them something back?</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Oooh.&nbsp; Let's do.&nbsp; Let's send them mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>RACHEL: No!&nbsp; Wait!&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; Don't do that!&nbsp; That's going to make them think
    they can come over here.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: So?&nbsp; What if they do?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Well, we're not here to meet guys.&nbsp; You have a boyfriend, I have a
    b. . . baby and a Ross.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.&nbsp; We're just having fun.&nbsp;
    You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.&nbsp; Chandler is seated in the chair and Monica stands behind the sofa.]</p>

<p>MONICA: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating
    on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?&nbsp; (Monica tips her head
    slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")&nbsp; I heard it.</p>
<p>MONICA: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: All right.&nbsp; I've got a plan.&nbsp; I'll go down the fire escape.</p>
<p>MONICA: Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Hear me out woman.&nbsp; I'll go down the fire escape.&nbsp; Then, I'll wait
    for a while.&nbsp; Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got
    back from Tulsa.&nbsp; Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy
    in here.</p>
<p>MONICA: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?&nbsp; (pause)&nbsp;
    I heard it.</p>
<p>(Chandler runs to the window, opens it, starts out, but returns, casually walking
    back to his chair.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: I'm just going to wait for a little while.</p>
<p>MONICA: Scary pigeon's back?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: It's huge.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.&nbsp; Three pizza crusts, two bottle caps and
    the plastic tripod are left in the otherwise empty pizza box.&nbsp; Mike is making
    hollow popping noises with his mouth.&nbsp; He begins to speak, but stops and pops
    his lips a few more times and takes a drink.&nbsp; Ross smiles as if he has thought
    of something to say, but then he stops and sinks back in a slump on the sofa.]</p>

<p>[Scene: The bar.&nbsp; Two men are chatting with Rachel and Phoebe.]</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh my God.&nbsp; I can't believe you live in that building.&nbsp; My grandmother
    lives in that building.&nbsp; Ida Green?&nbsp; No sense of personal space?&nbsp; Kind of smells
    like chicken?&nbsp; Looks like a potato.</p>
<p>BILL: "Spuds" is your grandmother?</p>
<p>RACHEL: That's my bubby!</p>
<p>KEVIN: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.&nbsp; Um. . . maybe we can get
    your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Yeah. . . I'm sorry.&nbsp; We weren't really looking for anything to happen
    with you guys.&nbsp; I, I have a boyfriend.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><br>
    KEVIN: All right. It's no big deal.<br>
    <br>
    BILL: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?<br>
    <br>
    RACHEL: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.&nbsp; But
    um. . .<br>
    <br>
    BILL: Then, can I have your number?<br>
    <br>
    RACHEL: (pause) I'm sorry, no.<br>
    <br>
    BILL: Okay. (They start to walk away.)<br>
    <br>
    RACHEL: Oh sure.&nbsp; (She pulls a business card from her purse and writes on it.)<br>
    <br>
    PHOEBE: (Reading the card.) Oh my God, you're giving your real number.<br>
    <br>
    BILL: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.<br>
    <br>
    RACHEL: Great.<br>
    <br>
    BILL: Bye<br>
    <br>
    PHOEBE: Bye. (The guys leave.) Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma
    are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?</p>
<p>RACHEL: I don't know.&nbsp; He was cute, and he liked me.&nbsp; It was an impulse.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: What about Ross?&nbsp; What about your moment?&nbsp; Don't you want to talk to
    Ross about it?</p>
<p>RACHEL: No.&nbsp; No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.&nbsp; "Hey
    Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."</p>
<p>RACHEL: (lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah."&nbsp; (Clears throat.)&nbsp; "Me too."</p>
<p>RACHEL: (as herself) "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about
    it."</p>
<p>RACHEL: (as Ross) "Yeah."&nbsp; (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat
    again.)</p>
<p>RACHEL: (as herself) "Well, should we just continue to live together and not
    really tell each other how we're really feeling?"</p>
<p>RACHEL: (as Ross) "Yeah.&nbsp; That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Yeah, I see what you mean.&nbsp; By the way, nice Ross imitation.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.</p>
<p>RACHEL: (whining) Wha. . . hey!</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (pointing) Better!</p>
<p>RACHEL: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments
    with Ross, you know?&nbsp; I should just . . . move on with my life.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Really?&nbsp; You're moving on from Ross?</p>
<p>RACHEL: I don't know.&nbsp; Do I have to decide right now?</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Well, you kind of just did.&nbsp; That guy is going to call you tonight.&nbsp;
    Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh God, Ross.&nbsp; Ross is going to pick up the phone.&nbsp; Oh, I have to get
    my number back.&nbsp; (She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)&nbsp; Oh my God.&nbsp;
    He's gone.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back.&nbsp; Oh my God.&nbsp;
    He's gone."&nbsp; (smiles) Dead on.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.&nbsp; Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa.
  Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out.
  Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.]</p>

<p>MIKE: (releases a whoosh of air) Ya know, I'm going to take off.</p>
<p>ROSS: So soon?</p>
<p>MIKE: Well, yeah.</p>
<p>ROSS: Okay.&nbsp; Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.</p>
<p>MIKE: Ah, you mean lager.</p>
<p>ROSS: Ah yeah.&nbsp; Good times.</p>
<p>(Mike leaves.&nbsp; Ross closes the door behind him.)</p>
<p>MIKE: (In the hall, relieved) Oh.</p>
<p>(Ross, inside the door, releases a sign of relief.&nbsp; Back in the hall, Mike's
    cell phone rings.)</p>
<p>MIKE: Hello?</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me.&nbsp; Listen,
    is um, is Ross near you?</p>
<p>MIKE: Uh, no.&nbsp; I just left.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: Well, you have to go back in.</p>
<p>MIKE: Wha . . .?&nbsp; Go back?&nbsp; To the "land where time stands still"?</p>
<p>PHOEBE: I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,
    um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.&nbsp; So, you have to intercept all
    his calls.</p>
<p>MIKE: I can't do that!</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (to Rachel) He says he can't do that.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh give me , , ,&nbsp; (Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)&nbsp; Hi, Mike?&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp;
    Listen.&nbsp; I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?&nbsp; If you do this I .
    . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.&nbsp; Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I'm sorry
    about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.</p>
<p>MIKE: All right.&nbsp; I'll do it.&nbsp; (Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)&nbsp;
    But really, how much dirtier can it get?</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.&nbsp; Bye.</p>
<p>(Mike knocks on Ross's door.&nbsp; Ross opens it.)</p>
<p>MIKE: Hey buddy.</p>
<p>ROSS: Uh, hi.</p>
<p>MIKE: Um, can I come back in?</p>
<p>ROSS: (putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.)&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; (He starts
    to lower his arm.)</p>
<p>MIKE: (Entering the apartment) I, I was just thinking about how much more we
    have to talk about.</p>
<p>ROSS: (whining) But you left.</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway and stairs outside Chandler and Monica's apartment.&nbsp; Chandler
    enters from the stairs.&nbsp; Joey is sitting with a baseball bat.]</p>

<p>JOEY: Wow!&nbsp; That didn't take long.&nbsp; I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three
    hour flight.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.</p>
<p>(Joey thinks a moment. Then, he nods.&nbsp; Joey follows Chandler into the apartment.)</p>
<p>MONICA: (gasp) Chandler!&nbsp; You're home!</p>
<p>CHANDLER: That's right.&nbsp; You're husband's home.&nbsp; So, now the sex can stop.</p>
<p>(Joey gives him and odd look.&nbsp; Monica gives a similar look.)</p>
<p>MONICA: What are you saying?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Joey said that you're in here with another man.</p>
<p>MONICA: There's no man in here.&nbsp; How dare you accuse me of that.&nbsp; (She slaps
    Chandler.)</p>
<p>JOEY: All right.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend
    take a look around, huh?&nbsp; (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.&nbsp; Then he
    proceeds to their bedroom.)&nbsp; Bwa-ah-ah!</p>
<p>(Thudding sounds can be heard from the bedroom.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (To Monica) What is he doing?</p>
<p>MONICA: (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.</p>
<p>JOEY: (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: All right.&nbsp; Well, I'll check the guest room.</p>
<p>JOEY: (sniffing the air and then Monica.)&nbsp; Why do I smell men's cologne?</p>
<p>MONICA: (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.</p>
<p>JOEY: (sniffs his shirt.)&nbsp; Oh yeah.&nbsp; I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: There's nobody here Joe.</p>
<p>JOEY: I guess not.</p>
<p>MONICA: I can't believe you thought I was cheating.&nbsp; (pointing at Joey) You
    own me an apology.</p>
<p>JOEY: Yeah, right Monica.&nbsp; I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>MONICA: (suddenly starts issuing him out) Ah, it's an honest mistake.&nbsp; It could
    happen to anyone.&nbsp; All right, see ya.</p>
<p>JOEY: (spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa,
    whoa.&nbsp; Wait a minute.&nbsp; Wait a minute.&nbsp; If you just got back from Tulsa, how
    did your suitcase beat you here?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: (thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you
    can't put that in the closet?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.&nbsp; Mike is reading from a book.]</p>

<p>MIKE: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the
    same thing.&nbsp; Fascinating isn't it.</p>
<p>ROSS: Maybe you should look up "fascinating."</p>
<p>(Phone rings.)</p>
<p>MIKE: I'll get it.&nbsp; (He lunges across Ross's lap on the sofa to reach the phone.&nbsp;
    Ross stares at him with wide eyes.)&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Ross's place.&nbsp; Mike speaking.&nbsp;
    (pause.&nbsp; Hands phone to Ross)&nbsp; It's for you.</p>
<p>ROSS: (takes the phone, but speaks to Mike) I don't understand what just happened
    here.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment " continuing action.]</p>

<p>JOEY: What's going on?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: I'm sorry.&nbsp; I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend
    the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .&nbsp; I didn't think you'd understand.</p>
<p>JOEY: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be
    with his wife?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Do you think I'm like, "Duh."&nbsp; (He strikes himself in
    the head with the bat.&nbsp; He stands dazed for a moment.)</p>
<p>MONICA: Joey?</p>
<p>JOEY: Yeah?&nbsp; (His eyes bug out.)</p>
<p>MONICA: I don't know what to say.&nbsp; We shouldn't have lied to you.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Yeah.&nbsp; I feel so bad.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do to make it up to
    you?</p>
<p>JOEY: (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know
    you said you couldn't.&nbsp; But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a
    bump on the head.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: I'm sorry. &nbsp;That's the one thing I can't do.&nbsp; I promised I'd be with
    Monica.</p>
<p>JOEY: All right.</p>
<p>MONICA: (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: What?</p>
<p>MONICA: You should go to the game.&nbsp; It's okay.&nbsp; I want you to.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Really?&nbsp; You're gonna be okay?</p>
<p>MONICA: Yeah, I'll be fine.&nbsp; You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the
    art of seduction.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?</p>
<p>MONICA: It's gonna be so hot!&nbsp; (She kisses him.)</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Okay, bye.</p>
<p>MONICA: Have fun.</p>
<p>JOEY: Thanks.&nbsp; (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.&nbsp; Joey pulls out the tickets
    and hands one to Chandler.)&nbsp; Here's your ticket.</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Hey, listen.&nbsp; I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?&nbsp; And I want
    you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.</p>
<p>JOEY: Thanks man.</p>
<p>(Chandler heads toward the stairs, but makes a turn back to his apartment while
    looking at the ticket.)</p>
<p>JOEY: Where are you going?</p>
<p>CHANDLER: Game's tomorrow night Joe.</p>
<p>(Chandler goes into the apartment, while Joey checks his ticket and is embarrassed
    by his stupid mistake.)</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries
    of normal social conduct.</p>
<p>MIKE: It's true.&nbsp; I did.</p>
<p>PHOEBE: (pause) Well, good bye.</p>

<p>ROSS: Rachel, lock the door.&nbsp; Lock the door,&nbsp; seriously.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh shoot.&nbsp; I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.&nbsp; (She exits to the
    hallway and closes the door behind her.)&nbsp; Wait, wait.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Did he call?&nbsp;
    Did that guy call?</p>
<p>MIKE: No.&nbsp; Just his mom.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh, around 8:30?</p>
<p>MIKE: Yeah.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Then, again at 9:00?</p>
<p>MIKE: (nods) uh-huh.</p>
<p>RACHEL: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Inside the apartment the phone rings.&nbsp; Ross answers it.)</p>
<p>ROSS: Hello.&nbsp; (listens)&nbsp; Ah, no, she's not here right now.&nbsp; Can I take a message?&nbsp;
    (grabs a pad and pen)&nbsp; Bill from the bar?&nbsp; (writes)&nbsp; Okay, "Bill from the bar."&nbsp;
    I'll make sure she gets your number.</p>
<p>(He hangs up the phone and tears the note off the pad.&nbsp; Then, he stops and
    re-reads it.&nbsp; Rachel enters.)</p>
<p>RACHEL: Aaah.&nbsp; (She goes to tend Emma.)</p>
<p>ROSS: So, ah . . . So, how was it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have
    a good time?</p>
<p>RACHEL: Oh, it was so much fun.&nbsp; It felt so good to be out.</p>
<p>ROSS: (holds up the message) Uh, Rach.</p>
<p>RACHEL: (still looking at Emma) Yeah?</p>
<p>ROSS: (pauses, then crunches up the note and stuffs it in his pocket.)&nbsp; Never
