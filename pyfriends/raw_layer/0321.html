<p align="left">[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are helping Monica learn
how to roller skate by rolling her between themselves.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So who&#146;s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, they took my idea!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That was you?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa. </p>

<p>[He distracts her from catching Monica and Monica slams into her, knocking her down.
Monica then falls on top of her.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, are you guys okay?</p>

<p><b>Gunther:</b> Are you all right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is
moaning in pain.) Oh my.</p>

<p>(They both turn and give him a dirty look.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Opening Credits</p>

<p></b>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching <i>Quincy M.E.</i> as Chandler is
walking into the living room from his bedroom.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sporting a goatee) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so that&#146;s why the priest threw holy water on me.
(there&#146;s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, <b>you</b> have to cheer up! Okay? You
should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here
crying all day about Kate.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy&#146;s theory.
Okay?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (triumphantly) I&#146;m gonna be on TV!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No way!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! They&#146;re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils
they just found in Peru and <i>The Discovery Channel&#146;s</i> gonna film it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! Who&#146;s gonna watch that?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. You ready to go?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. (they start to leave)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Saw a girl with that vest.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)</p>

<p><b>Anchorwoman:</b> (on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as
traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is
intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys
won&#146;t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little
baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? &#145;Cause I
was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Pete is entering, Monica is on roller skates.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi! Hey, Pete you&#146;re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to
skate over to him)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Wow! Skates! </p>

<p>(She gets just about all the way over to him and falls into his arms.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! You&#146;re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece
of paper. So how was you&#146;re trip?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, what&#146;d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel
toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some
coffee?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, sure, that&#146;d be great.</p>

<p>(She starts to go and get the coffee and falls behind the counter.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (popping back up) Regular or decaf?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Ah, which ever is closest. </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (hands him a cup)</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> So ask me what I did today.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So what did you do today Pete?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is telling Rachel about Pete&#146;s offer.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven
and opened Easy Monica&#146;s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can
totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But
Pete&#146;s just doing this because he has a crush on me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> And you&#146;re still not attracted to him at all?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I
can&#146;t. I couldn&#146;t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but Mon that&#146;s totally different. He was you&#146;re health
teacher.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, please. </p>

<p>(She slaps Rachel&#146;s side and Rachel screams in pain.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What? Honey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God, I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. </p>

<p>(Monica hugs her goes and hugs her)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ow!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!
Guess what?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Y'know what I didn&#146;t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
Well, guess what? You&#146;re not my girlfriend anymore so...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now that you&#146;re on you&#146;re own, you&#146;re free to look as
stupid as you like.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica) You like it right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I&#146;m kidding!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, come here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What-what was it you were gonna tell us? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, good bye! (leaves)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about her suggestion.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take
for the roller skating thing to happen.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, oh, about three months.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so I guess that&#146;s about ah, two weeks before the topless
thing kicks in.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering carrying a box) Hey!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I got you something! Open it! Open it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (He opens it and it&#146;s a baby chick) It&#146;s a chicken.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> It&#146;s cute, huh?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They
require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot&#146;s and lot&#146;s
of love.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,
and talks to it like it&#146;s a little baby.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Easy Lenny.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Moondance Diner, Pete is talking to Monica about the restaurant.]</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> So? I mean have you thought about it?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Here&#146;s the thing.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What&#146;s the thing?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&#146;t do it. I&#146;m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you
have these feelings for me....</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Wait, wait, wait, wait, that&#146;s-that&#146;s what you&#146;re worried
about? If that&#146;s the problem, we&#146;ve got no problem.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.
On my trip.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Her name&#146;s Ann, she&#146;s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.
She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had
a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that&#146;s great! I mean I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry, but I&#146;m so
happy for you. And now I can work for you!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> I guess you can.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him
on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I&#146;m just gonna roll right into that office
and-and quit!</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, sure. Good luck!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (rolling towards the office) I&#146;m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls
through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the
door the other way.) I&#146;m okay!! I&#146;m all right!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Pete) Wow! That&#146;s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&#146;m just saying, this woman, I mean she&#146;s fictitious. No?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Why would you say that?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &#145;Cause you&#146;re still into Monica. So you told her there was
somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so &#145;cause you figure oh if you
spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> You&#146;re good. You&#146;re good!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, no, I&#146;m fairly intuitive and psychic. It&#146;s a substantial
gift.</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Listen, can you promise me that you won&#146;t tell her though?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?</p>

<p><b>Pete:</b> Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No I&#146;m serious. I mean I&#146;m intuitive, but my memory sucks.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is baby-chick sitting.]</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,
and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey
enters)-chickeeeen.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> How&#146;s she doing?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> She?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well yeah, don&#146;t-don&#146;t you think it&#146;s a she?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#146;t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to
determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can&#146;t tell, what ever it was went
back in too quickly.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, anyway, I got to go change, I&#146;m ah, meeting some of the cast
for drinks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody
could be here with our chick!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Who was up from 2 o&#146;clock this morning until 5 o&#146;clock this
morning trying to get her back to sleep?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You don&#146;t think I get up when you get up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohhh, here it comes.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, here it comes! I&#146;m stuck here all day, and then you come in
and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well I don&#146;t think so mister!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you don&#146;t think taking care of our chick is work?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this
chick, we&#146;ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&#146;t know, maybe we weren&#146;t ready to have a chick.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;ll take her back tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you think we&#146;ll get our three bucks back?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Really? (Joey gives him a &#145;Like I would know&#146; look)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to take some aspirin.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! That aspirin dance really works!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, is that still...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&#146;m fine, I&#146;m fine.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No you&#146;re not.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes I am! </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, I&#146;m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)
Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)
Whoa-whoa!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. I have <b>got</b> to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses
house. It&#146;s a very big deal, there&#146;s a lot of people there I have to meet.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And I&#146;m sure you&#146;re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I&#146;m
Rachel Green. It&#146;s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands
with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,
you probably have a broken rib!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it&#146;ll still be broken
then.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, either help me or go.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. I&#146;ll go.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (He checks his watch) Sure. I&#146;ll help you.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!</p>

<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</p>

<p></b>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s bedroom, Rachel is trying to put on eye liner with her left
hand, as Ross is setting out her shoes.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He
doesn&#146;t like how it tastes.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (taking the brush back) Okay. Let&#146;s use this brush. (Hands him
another one.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. This stuff? </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-ho!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! That&#146;s just poking me in the eye!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry, I&#146;m sorry. Close, close, close...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, just sweep it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;m sweeping...</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, now make it even, &#145;cause we don&#146;t...</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We don&#146;t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.</p>

<p>(Of course it&#146;s too late for that.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No, y'know you don&#146;t, you don&#146;t wear enough of this. (Rachel
is shocked) What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Since when, since when do you think I don&#146;t wear enough of this?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I, close your eyes, I just think you&#146;re gonna like this a little
better, &#145;cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Blow it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (blows it) Sorry. &#145;Cause umm, I think this will make you a little
more sophisticated.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sophisticated like a hooker?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, I have to tell you something.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But I can&#146;t tell you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, but wouldn&#146;t it be easier if you had to tell me something
that you could tell me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn&#146;t tell,
and I swore to like all my gods.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Does it have to do with Joey?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but let&#146;s come back to that later!</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s Bedroom, Ross is finishing up her make-up.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?</p>

<p>(She turns and looks in the mirror, and it&#146;s way, way over done. She looks like
she has two black eyes.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yep?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure, I&#146;ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&#146;t want you to see me naked!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel, I&#146;ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you
naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but that was different. Y&#146;know? I mean, we were, we were
going out then, now I think it&#146;s weird.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Stop that!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! I don&#146;t want you thinking of me like that any more!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It&#146;s one of my ah, rights as
the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, I&#146;m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!
Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I&#146;m the king. </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay? (goes into the living room)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)
Oww!!!! God!</p>

to the shelter, and you know what I found out? </p>

and Joey move over to the windows and away from the chick.) </p>

not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!</p>
