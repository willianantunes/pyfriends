<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to
    London and Monica comes running in.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to
    get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,
    there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Six-hour trip to London. Thatâ€™s a lot of Monica.</p>

<p>[Cut to the girlsâ€™ apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe
    and Rachel watch.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
    check! Travellerâ€™s cheques, check! </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who are you saying "check" too?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Myself. Yâ€™know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good
    thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only
    did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Are you ready yet?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yep! You got the tickets?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! Got â€˜em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!</p>

<p>[Cut to the guysâ€™ apartment.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Itâ€™s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
    enthused Chandler and starts towards the girlsâ€™ apartment.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You got your passport?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You donâ€™t want to lose that.</p>

<p>(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesnâ€™t know why, it takes him a little bit
    to figure it out.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> There it is.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where everything is.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, if you need the vacuum, itâ€™s in my closet on the left-hand
    side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigeratorâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, okay, but Rachelâ€™s gonna be here too, canâ€™t I just ask
    her this stuff?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, okay, give that a try!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Joey) All right! Letâ€™s do it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Woo-hoo!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, cheerie-o! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> London baby!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, â€˜cause thatâ€™s not gonna get annoying.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (louder) London baby!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, yâ€™know what? I was wrong.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, weâ€™re all here! I guess we should get going!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on
    your wedding, but I donâ€™tâ€”canâ€™t get up.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, Iâ€™ll-Iâ€™ll come hug you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, have a great wedding!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! (Trots over)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, itâ€™s on the
    counter in your apartment.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebeâ€™s book as Rachel comes in from her
    room.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) So, weâ€™re off.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Have fun!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I canâ€™t believe youâ€™re not gonna be
    there!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So-so come! Why donâ€™t you come?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> To London! Come to London. Please? Itâ€™ll mean so much to me.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, I gotta work, Iâ€™m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why-why canâ€™t you take a couple of days off?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, I canâ€™t! Ross, I told you, no. I canâ€™t.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> This is my wedding.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, yâ€™know what? We really are late! Letâ€™s go!
    Letâ€™s go! Letâ€™s go!!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. Youâ€™ll-youâ€™ll watch it on video when we get back.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Phoebeâ€™s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go
    Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, letâ€™s go! Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p>(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says "bye." In the
    hall, Joey saysâ€¦)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, do you need a hug? You donâ€™t have to bring me anything!</p>

<p>(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show
    moves itâ€™s entire production to an entirely different country to make a single
    episode. We get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the <i>London
        Marriott</i> as Joey and Chandler exit.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Street in front of the <i>London Marriott</i>, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is
    carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! Do something!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am, Iâ€™m ignoring you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All
    right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of
    London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, what the hell is that?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Itâ€™s London, baby! All right, the hotelâ€™s here. (Points to the
    map.) Wait. No, we wanna goâ€¦ No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Iâ€™m gonna have to
    go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. Listen-listen, weâ€™re not gonna have to walk this way the
    entire time are we?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Another street, somewhere along the River Themes, Ross, Emily, and Monica are
    walking to where theyâ€™re gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the
    caterer.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> â€¦and that was all before 10 oâ€™clock. The caterer rang and said
    it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned
    to say there arenâ€™t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.
    Weâ€™re not gonna beâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Well, up yours too!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! No! No! Thatâ€™s-thatâ€™s time-out!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everythingâ€™s gonna be great, okay? Come on.
    Come on.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chicken Kiev?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um-hmm! Doesnâ€™t that sound delicious at the last minute?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, yâ€™know, but something like salmon which would be so much more
    elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldnâ€™t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross
    pushes her.) So, I canâ€™t wait to see this place youâ€™re getting married!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emilyâ€™s parents got married
    here.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I still canâ€™t believe theyâ€™re tearing it down. It really is the
    most lovely building youâ€™ll ever see. I mean itâ€™s overâ€¦ (She stops
    suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Itâ€™s nice.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)</p>

<p>[Cut to inside.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What
    are we going to do?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Itâ€™s all right! Everythingâ€™s gonna be all right.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Howâ€™s it gonna be all right?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh, I see that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out
    what happened. </p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> They torn it down a few days early.</p>

<p>[Scene: Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of
    London and are approaching the Abbey.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey Iâ€™ve ever seen.
    Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,
    Chandler?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think itâ€™s great. Itâ€™s great. Yâ€™know, theyâ€™re
    thinking of changing the name of this place.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? To what?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> To Put the Camera Away!!!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, <b>you</b> are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler
    towards the Abbey.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Oh.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey! Donâ€™t get up! What do you need?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no. Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I have a wedgie.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, that is all you.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So-so, what do you want for lunch?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I donâ€™t know. I guess we <b>have</b> to eat.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I do. Whatâ€™s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Iâ€™m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I
    shouldnâ€™t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eh, donâ€™t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love
    with was getting marriedâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) Still in love with?! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Iâ€™m not in love with Ross!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, Iâ€™m going to Rossâ€™s wedding because he is my
    ex-boyfriend and that would be <b>really</b> uncomfortable. Not because, Iâ€™m still in
    love with him! I mean, hey, yâ€™know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, yâ€™know?
    <b>Clearly</b> I have feelings for him, but feelings donâ€™t mean love! I mean, I still
    have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but
    that doesnâ€™t mean that-that Iâ€™m still in love with him. Yâ€™know? I-I have
    sexual feelings for him, but I <b>do</b> love himâ€”Ohh! Oh my God! Oh myâ€”why
    didnâ€™t you tell me?!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We thought you knew!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> We?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You all know? Does Ross know?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, Ross doesnâ€™t know anything.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I can not believe you didnâ€™t tell me!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, because we thought you knew!! Itâ€™s so obvious! God, that
    would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."</p>

<p>[Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> So, what are you guys in the market for? Weâ€™ve got uh, scarves,
    tulip post cards...</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on
    the front of it.) Yeah. Thatâ€™s the stuff. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I donâ€™t have to buy that, "Iâ€™m with stupid"
    T-shirt anymore.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, youâ€™re not really gonna buy that are you?
    Donâ€™t you think youâ€™ve embarrassed me enough for one day?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I embarrass you? </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can I answer that when Iâ€™m pretending I donâ€™t know you?</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> Heâ€™s just jealous. Youâ€™ll fit right in; all Londoners wear
    them!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> (looks around) Theyâ€™re all tourists.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,
    yâ€™know, youâ€™re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If youâ€™re gonna make me choose between
    you and the hat? I choose the hat.</p>

<p><b>The Vendor:</b> Good choice.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, wait. All right, thatâ€™s it, okay, Iâ€™m out of here. I
    am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand
    and walks away trying to be cool.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hotel, Rossâ€™s room, Emily is entering.]</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Hello?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think
    weâ€™ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> We donâ€™t have to.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
    being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> She said what?</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> She said, "If Iâ€™m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere
    that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents
    spent on this wedding? Do you my sisterâ€™s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that
    people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts
    his pants on backwards.) This isnâ€™t right.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Iâ€™m sure
    theyâ€™ll come back when we can do it right.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I canâ€™t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
    (Holds out his pants)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Donâ€™t you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We
    have no choice! Anywhere thatâ€™s half-decent wouldâ€™ve be booked months ago, Ross
    donâ€™t you understand? This is our wedding Iâ€™m talking about.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is
    when weâ€™re getting married.</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> So what are you saying? Itâ€™s now or never?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No. Iâ€™m saying itâ€™s now. (He starts putting on his pants,
    backwards again.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Or?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thereâ€™s no â€˜orâ€™ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Itâ€™s not the pants. Itâ€™s you that is backwards. And if, and if
    you donâ€™t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we
    shouldnâ€™t get married at all! (She storms out.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
    wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, pleaseâ€”(He catches something important in the
    zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the couch as Rachel returns carrying a bunch of shopping bags.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (depressed) Hi.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Manhattan does not have enough stores.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, <b>I</b> think I can help you get over him.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> You can?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a small piece of chocolate.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
    graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,
    the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didnâ€™t feel like getting up. Okay,
    Iâ€™m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And youâ€™re going to remember all of
    the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
    love Ross, I think heâ€™s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs
    it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youâ€™re with Ross
    okay and imagine that youâ€™re kissing him. And youâ€™re-youâ€™re running your
    hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross
    itâ€™s some kind of grease, itâ€™sâ€”uck! Hah?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> I donâ€™t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,
    and yâ€™know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, letâ€™s try
    some uh, aversion therapy.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So uh, now look at the pictureâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, and ummâ€¦ (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the
    head.) </p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ow!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, how do you feel now?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I like <b>you</b> less!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joeyâ€™s hotel room. Chandler is watching TV as Joey returns,
    still wearing his hat.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey. (He nods at the hat.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no, yâ€™know what? I really shouldnâ€™t have said that you
    were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnâ€™t cool. And if it makes you feel any
    better, Iâ€™ve had a really lousy day.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Noo!! Iâ€™ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the tape Joey made in front of some famous place in London with a rather famous
    English-type person.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
</p>

<p><b>Fergie:</b> (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, whatâ€™s your
    friendâ€™s name?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on tape) Oh, Chandler.</p>

<p><b>Fergie:</b> Hi Chandler! (Waves) </p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s wasâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thatâ€™s Fergie baby!!</p>

<p><b>Fergie:</b> Joey says you donâ€™t really like his hat, but I think itâ€™s
    kinda dashing.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> How did you? How? How?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
    So, Iâ€™m in my map and-andâ€¦(Ross enters) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Yes, I did! And <b>you</b> are welcome!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Am I?! And was it <b>your</b> idea to postpone the wedding?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ummâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Iâ€™m gonna go to the bathroom.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey-hey, since youâ€™re the â€˜fix-itâ€™ lady, hereâ€™s a
    pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnâ€™t want to have the wedding at
    all?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> She said that?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I donâ€™t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just
    because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. Youâ€™re even dumber than <b>I</b> am!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I donâ€™t know. A month?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
    first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thatâ€™s what we
    did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect
    four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets
    thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most
    important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that
    other stuff was.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were
    just doing the flying nun.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sometimes we were.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was pretty intense huh?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didnâ€™t think that we just went in
    there because we were uncomfortable being out here!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (glares at him) I hope he did!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Phoebe answers it.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! Itâ€™s Joey!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on theâ€”that looks just
    like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say â€˜hi!â€™ but then I
    figured, he doesnâ€™t care if he looks like you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the
    chick and the duck are doing?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, theyâ€™re having a <b>great</b> time with their Aunt Phoebe!
    Aunt Rachel hasnâ€™t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Kinda, but Iâ€™ve just been having way too much fun.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So youâ€™re not homesick yet?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I donâ€™t think so.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoâ€™s seven?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yâ€™know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babiesâ€¦</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh, the babies miss me?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, the pizza guyâ€™s here!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? You ordered pizza without me?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. But yâ€™know we were thinking about you, yâ€™know we ordered
    the Joey Special.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Two pizzas?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, well, where did you get it from?! </p>

<p>(Phoebe has already hung up, leaving Joey in the dark. So Joey decides to watch some TV
    and turns on a rerun of <i>Cheers</i>, with the theme song playing. At first, heâ€™s
    happy, but as the song progresses Joey gets depressed and homesick.)</p>

<p>(At that Ross plugs in some Christmas lights to light the place up.)</p>

<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh God.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little
    alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), andâ€¦ (Points to Ross) You

<p><b>Ross:</b> But-but, if you donâ€™t love this, weâ€™ll do it in any other place

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! What do you mean youâ€™re going to London?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you
    donâ€™t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Iâ€”Rachel, you canâ€™t go! Ross loves Emily!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!
    He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thatâ€™s not why youâ€™re going! Youâ€™re going because you
    hope heâ€™s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British
    chippy."</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhâ€”Do you think he will?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Because heâ€™s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if
    you go, youâ€™re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Yâ€™know,
    itâ€™s too late! You missed youâ€™re chance! Iâ€™m sorry, I know this must be
    really hard, itâ€™s over.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yâ€™know what? No. Itâ€™s not over until someone says, "I
    do." (Exits)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesnâ€™t

    (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long
    time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks
    embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over
    inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Mr. Geller: </b>All-right fine, but I just want to say, Iâ€™m not paying for your

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler: </b>Because heâ€™s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me
    for my very moving performance in Titanic.</p>

    have. (He hugs her.)</p>

    cheek.) Your here. I canâ€™t believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel: </b>Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. Sheâ€™s almost in
    tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.)
