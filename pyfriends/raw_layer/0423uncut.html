<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to
    London and Monica comes running in.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get
    a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there
    could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>

</b>
    <p><b>Joey</b>: What do you got there?</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Chandler</b>: Condoms, dude!</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Joey </b>(looks at the box): How come the writing is in Spanish?</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Chandler</b>: Don't read my condoms!</p>
</font>

<p>[Cut to the girls' apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe and
    Rachel watch.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
    check! Traveller's cheques, check! </p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Who are you saying "check" too?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing,
    you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did
    it the one time. But it was pretty weird.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: (entering) Hey!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Hey!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey! Are you ready yet?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Yep! You got the tickets?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh! Got 'em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!</p>

<p>[Cut to the guys' apartment.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: It's all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
    enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls' apartment.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: You got your passport?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.</p>

<p>(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesn't know why, it takes him a little bit to
    figure it out.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: There it is.</p>

    <p align="CENTER">Opening Credits</p>
</b>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where
    everything is.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah,
    the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this
    stuff?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah, okay, give that a try!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: (entering, with Joey) All right! Let's do it!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Woo-hoo!!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah, cheerie-o! </p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: London baby!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: (louder) London baby!!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your
    wedding, but I don't-can't get up.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, have a great wedding!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Thanks.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey! (Trots over)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in
    your apartment.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's book as Rachel comes in from her room.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: (to Rachel) So, we're off.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Have fun!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, I know.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: So-so come! Why don't you come?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: What?!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: This is my wedding.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: (entering, with Phoebe's book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo!
    Phewbedo! Phaybobo.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: (laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Bye, Pheebs!</p>

<p>(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says "bye." In the
    hall, Joey says...)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!</p>

<p>(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show
    moves it's entire production to an entirely different country to make a single episode. We
    get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the London Marriott as Joey
    and Chandler exit.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Street in front of the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is
    carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Come on! Do something!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: I am, I'm ignoring you.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right,
    first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of London. All
    of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Oh, what the hell is that?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. (Points to the map.) Wait.
    No, we wanna go... No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I'm gonna have to go into the map. (So
    Joey literally steps into the map.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire
    time are we?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Another street, somewhere along the River Thames, Ross, Emily, and Monica are
    walking to where they're gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the
    caterer.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was
    going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say
    there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna
    be...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: Well, up yours too!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: What?! </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>

</b>
    <p><b>Emily</b>: Oh, that's not what it means?</p>
</font><b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: No! No! That's-that's time-out!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: Sorry.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come
    on.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Chicken Kiev?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant
    than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.)
    <font color="#0000ff">But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the
        chickenella...</font> So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely
    building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... (She stops suddenly, when she sees that
    demolition has already started.) Oh my God!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: It's nice.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)</p>

<p>[Cut to inside.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are
    we going to do?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: How's it gonna be all right?!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Uh-huh, I see that.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what
    happened. </p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: What? What?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: They tore it down a few days early.</p>
<font color="#0000ff">

    <p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey are sitting on the top floor on one of the red coaches in
        London that doesn't have a roof. Joey is very enthusiastic and is pointing at all the
        different sights. Chandler is really embarrassed and tries to make him stop. Afterwards,
        Joey tries to film Chandler with his video camera, and Chandler obviously hates this.
        Then, Joey falls asleep, and Chandler tries to take the video camera away from him.
        However, Joey is holding onto it (in his sleep) and won't let it go. Chandler pulls until
        Joey lets it go, causing Chandler to fall out of his seat.]</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of
    London and are approaching the Abbey.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey!
    (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the
    name of this place.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Really? To what?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: To Put the Camera Away!!!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the
    Abbey.)</p>
<font color="#0000ff">

    <p>[Scene: A bridal shop somewhere in London. Monica is trying on her red bridesmaid
        dress, and Emily is watching. A dressmaker is working on Monica's dress.]</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Monica</b>: Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.</p>

    <p>(The dressmaker puts a pin in the dress, but accidentally pricks Monica with it.)</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Monica</b>: Oowww!!</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Dressmaker</b>: Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Emily</b>: We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered
        chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life
        is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Monica</b>: You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you
        postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all
        the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have
        salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Emily</b>: I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Monica</b>: But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's
        gonna like you better than me.</p>

    <p>(Emily smiles a bit and looks uncomfortable.)</p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel
    enters.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh. Oh.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, I have a wedgie.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, that is all you.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: So-so, what do you want for lunch?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, I do. What's the matter?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have
    lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was
    getting married...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: (interrupting) Still in love with?! </p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: I'm not in love with Ross!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that
    would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey,
    y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but
    feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I
    have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in
    love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God!
    Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: We thought you knew!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: We?!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: You all know? Does Ross know?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be
    like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." <font color="#0000ff">Or,
        y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."</font></p><font color="#0000ff">

    <p>(Rachel stares at her.)</p>

    </b>
    <p><b>Rachel</b>: What?!</p>

    </b>
    <p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>The Vendor</b>: So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip
    post cards...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the
    front of it.) Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt
    anymore.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you
    think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh, I embarrass you? </p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>The Vendor</b>: He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>The Vendor</b>: (looks around) They're all tourists.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're
    gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you're gonna make me choose between you and
    the hat? I choose the hat.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>The Vendor</b>: Good choice.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey</b>: Thanks.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going
    to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away
    trying to be cool.)</p>
<font color="#0000ff">

    <p>(A man walks up to Joey and stares at Chandler and the flower stand. Joey turns around
        to introduce himself.)</p>

    </b>
    <p><b>Joey</b>: How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.</p>

    <p>(Joey shakes his hand. The man looks at him and his hat.)</p>
</font>

<p>[Scene: The hotel, Ross's room, Emily is entering.]</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: Hello?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be
    able to find a new place for the wedding.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: We don't have to.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
    being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: She said what?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we
    find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent
    on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took
    time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on
    backwards.) This isn't right.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll
    come back when we can do it right.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out
    his pants)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: Don't you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no
    choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you
    understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when
    we're getting married.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: So what are you saying? It's now or never?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: No. I'm saying it's now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: Or?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily</b>: It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't
    understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at
    all! (She storms out.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
    wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-(He catches something important in the zipper
    and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey!</p>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: (depressed) Hi.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Manhattan does not have enough stores.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, I think I can help you get over him.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: You can?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Um-hmm.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: And a small piece of chocolate.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
    graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the
    water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna
    show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about
    him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
    love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it
    out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and
    imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.
    And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease,
    it's-uck! Hah?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and
    y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh,
    aversion therapy.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: All right.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: So uh, now look at the picture...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: All right, and umm... (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.) </p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ow!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, how do you feel now?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, I like you less!</p>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah.</p>

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: I don't know. A month?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
    first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did!
    We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered
    wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of
    Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is
    that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just
    doing the flying nun.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Sometimes we were.</p>

</b>
<p><b>Ross</b>: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?</p>

    your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be
    tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.
    (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long
    time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks
    embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over
    inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear
    God.. (A cellular phone rings.)</p>

    I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody
    knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I
    love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?</p>

<p>(One of the bridesmaids, Felicity, puts her arm around Joey.)</p>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. (A

    after the wedding.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Mr. Geller</b>: All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine
    cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
    (Emily's stepmum looks shocked. Jack and Judy get up and leave.)</p>

<p>(Chandler's trying to console Monica.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica</b>: Then why would he say it?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler</b>: Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my
    very moving performance in <em>Titanic</em>.</p>

</b>
<p><b>Minister:</b> May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring on
    Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his finger)
    Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Happy to.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Minister:</b> Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great
    pleasure to declare them husband and wife.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Minister:</b> You may kiss the bride.</p>

<p>(He goes to kiss her, but she isn't very receptive of the kiss. She keeps avoiding him,
    until Ross finally gets to kiss her on her cheek.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.</p>

<p>(The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily's hand,
    but she snatches it away from him.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Just keep smiling.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that went well. Yeah.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It could've been worse, he could've shot her.</p>

<p>(Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?</p>

<p>(Emily gives him a forearm shot across the stomach.)</p>

    you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a
    circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't
    mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?</p>

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was
    because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, right!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get the hell out of there, y'know?</p>

<p>(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realise what she just said and run
    over to the bathroom.)</p>

    to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)</p>

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Ross said my name.</p>

</b>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth
    grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in
    a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)</p>

<p>(Cut to Chandler's room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after
    seeing that he isn't, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, you look...</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No time for that!</p>

<p>(They both start to frantically rip each other's clothes off, but are interrupted when

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie
    in here?</p>

    this.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The <b>room</b>
    expects sex. The <b>room</b> would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other
    honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<b>

</b>

<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think you should keep looking!</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, for about 30 minutes.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Or 45.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept
    moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right
    here.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it's getting late.</p>
