# PyFriends

This is WIP (Work In Progress). More to come soon! ðŸ˜‰

I'm using the compose service [app](https://github.com/willianantunes/pyfriends/blob/164423598fa12000079cea80eb87f070b44d7c2d/docker-compose.yaml#L4) as the remote interpreter.

## Delta architecture

I'm sort of following the [Delta Architecture](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/14/productionizing-machine-learning-with-delta-lake.html) design pattern, but changed a bit to fit this small project. Here you'll find the following layers:

- [Raw layer](./pyfriends/raw_layer): As the name suggests, you'll find the raw data, without any processing. Although, in real projects, it may contain [profiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_profiling) of all attributes, scoring the data in terms of its adherence to domain business and its typing, and governance (like [data catalog](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/index.php?title=Data_Catalog&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop) and many more) and security.
- [Integration layer](./pyfriends/integration_layer): The data is organized and a clear pattern can be noticed. In other words, you can query the data through well-organized tables. They may have relationship which reflects how it is in real-world, but there is no KPIs created from it. It means the data is queryable and ready for insights, but without business rules. As always, governance and security play a role here too.
- [Business layer](./pyfriends/business_layer): The KPIs can be found here, and it's a layer where an user without expertise in query can understand data easily. Again, governance and security are involved to guarantee many aspects of each domain.
